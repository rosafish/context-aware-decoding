However, Mike is not someone who gives up so easily \u2014 he has a plan to watch the match.\nThe field where the match is played is surrounded by a wall with height $K$. Outside, there are $N$ boxes (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th box has a height $H_i$.\nMike wants to take some boxes and stack them on top of each other to build two towers. The height of each tower is the sum of heights of all the boxes that form it. Of course, no box may be in both towers. The height of each tower should be at least $K$. Then Mike can climb on top of one tower and Tracy on top of the other, and they can watch the match uninterrupted!\nWhile Mike is busy stacking the boxes, Tracy would like to know the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers such that each of them has height at least $K$, or at least that it is impossible to build such towers. Can you help Tracy?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nChristmas is coming, and our protagonist, Bob, is preparing a spectacular present for his long-time best friend Alice. This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer $k > 1$ such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by $k$. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. \n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible.

He has a checkered field of size n \u00d7 n cells, where m various cells are banned. Before the game, he has to put a few chips on some border (but not corner) board cells. Then for n - 1 minutes, Gerald every minute moves each chip into an adjacent cell. He moves each chip from its original edge to the opposite edge. Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases:  At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell.  At least once two chips were on the same cell.  At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). \n\nIn that case he loses and earns 0 points. When nothing like that happened, he wins and earns the number of points equal to the number of chips he managed to put on the board. Help Gerald earn the most points.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the field and the number of banned cells. Next m lines each contain two space-separated integers. Specifically, the i-th of these lines contains numbers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th banned cell. All given cells are distinct.\n\nConsider the field rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n, and the columns \u2014 from left to right from 1 to n.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum points Gerald can earn in this game.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 3\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test the answer equals zero as we can't put chips into the corner cells.\n\nIn the second sample we can place one chip into either cell (1, 2), or cell (3, 2), or cell (2, 1), or cell (2, 3).

Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 \u2264 h, w \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000). \n\nNext n lines contain the description of black cells.

The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and n columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second.

Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\n\n [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 for pretests and tests or t = 1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of t sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers n, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of n character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the k trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB......CCCCC\n........DDDDD...\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\n.......DDDDD....\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\nInput\n2\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n.....AAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n....AAAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset.\n\nAnswer:\ndef dfs(x, y):\n    vis.append((x, y))\n    y += 1\n    nonlocal flag\n    if flag or str.isalpha(grid[x][y]):\n        return\n    if y >= n - 1:\n        flag = True\n        return\n    \n    # stay idle\n    if not str.isalpha(grid[x][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x][y + 2]) and (x, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x, y + 2)\n\n    # move down\n    if x > 0 and  not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y + 2]) and (x - 1, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x - 1, y + 2)\n\n    #move up\n    if x < 2 and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y + 2]) and (x + 1, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x + 1, y + 2)\n    \n\nT = int(input())\nfor loop in range(T):\n    n, k = [ int(i) for i in input().split() ]\n    grid = list()\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    vis = list()\n    flag = False\n    for i in  range(3):\n        if grid[i][0] == 's':\n            grid[i] = \" \" + grid[i][1:]\n            dfs(i, 0)\n            break\n    if flag:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nQUESTION:\nMaria participates in a bicycle race.\n\nThe speedway takes place on the shores of Lake Lucerne, just repeating its contour.

The children in the queue after the v_{i}-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the j-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of d_{j} and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the j-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of d_{j}.\n\nAll these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\n\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure. Print their numbers in the chronological order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000) \u2014 the number of kids in the line. \n\nNext n lines contain three integers each v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} (1 \u2264 v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry in the hall and the confidence of the i-th child.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print number k \u2014 the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure.\n\nIn the second line print k integers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will make it to the end of the line in the increasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 2 2\n4 1 2\n5 2 4\n3 3 5\n5 1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 3 \nInput\n5\n4 5 1\n5 3 9\n4 1 2\n2 1 8\n4 1 9\n\nOutput\n4\n1 2 4 5 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first child who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to  - 2, 1, 3, 1, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 2, 0. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.\n\nIn the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,  - 1, 6, 8. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5, 5, 7. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 3. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\nv = [ list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\n\nres = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\tif v[i][2] >= 0:\n\t\tres.append(i + 1)\n\t\tdec = 0\n\t\tfor j in range(i + 1, n):\n\t\t\tif v[j][2] >= 0:\n\t\t\t\tif v[i][0] > 0:\n\t\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= v[i][0]\n\t\t\t\t\tv[i][0] -= 1\n\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= dec\n\t\t\t\tif v[j][2] < 0: dec += v[j][1]\n\nprint(len(res))\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n\nQUESTION:\nMany students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2i - 1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2i)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students i and j talk, then the i-th student's happiness increases by g_{ij} and the j-th student's happiness increases by g_{ji}. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows g_{ij} (0 \u2264 g_{ij} \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that g_{ii} = 0 for all i.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n32\n\nInput\n0 43 21 18 2\n3 0 21 11 65\n5 2 0 1 4\n54 62 12 0 99\n87 64 81 33 0\n\nOutput\n620\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154.

Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or \"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.\n\nJeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible).

Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string $s = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_{n}$ of length $n$ where each letter is either R, S or P.\n\nWhile initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index $pos$ ($1 \\le pos \\le n$), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses \"Rock\", \"Scissors\" or \"Paper\" based on the value of $s_{pos}$:   if $s_{pos}$ is equal to R the bot chooses \"Rock\";  if $s_{pos}$ is equal to S the bot chooses \"Scissors\";  if $s_{pos}$ is equal to P the bot chooses \"Paper\"; \n\nIn the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of $s_{pos + 1}$. In the third round\u00a0\u2014 on $s_{pos + 2}$ and so on. After $s_n$ the bot returns to $s_1$ and continues his game.\n\nYou plan to play $n$ rounds and you've already figured out the string $s$ but still don't know what is the starting index $pos$. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find $n$ choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.\n\nIn other words, let's suggest your choices are $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_n$ and if the bot starts from index $pos$ then you'll win in $win(pos)$ rounds. Find $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_n$ such that $\\frac{win(1) + win(2) + \\dots + win(n)}{n}$ is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nNext $t$ lines contain test cases\u00a0\u2014 one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string $s = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_{n}$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $s_i \\in \\{\\text{R}, \\text{S}, \\text{P}\\}$)\u00a0\u2014 the string of the bot.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total length of all strings in one test doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print $n$ choices $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_n$ to maximize the average number of wins. Print them in the same manner as the string $s$.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\nRRRR\nRSP\nS\n\nOutput\nPPPP\nRSP\nR\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the bot (wherever it starts) will always choose \"Rock\", so we can always choose \"Paper\". So, in any case, we will win all $n = 4$ rounds, so the average is also equal to $4$.\n\nIn the second test case:   if bot will start from $pos = 1$, then $(s_1, c_1)$ is draw, $(s_2, c_2)$ is draw and $(s_3, c_3)$ is draw, so $win(1) = 0$;  if bot will start from $pos = 2$, then $(s_2, c_1)$ is win, $(s_3, c_2)$ is win and $(s_1, c_3)$ is win, so $win(2) = 3$;  if bot will start from $pos = 3$, then $(s_3, c_1)$ is lose, $(s_1, c_2)$ is lose and $(s_2, c_3)$ is lose, so $win(3) = 0$;  The average is equal to $\\frac{0 + 3 + 0}{3} = 1$ and it can be proven that it's the maximum possible average.\n\nA picture from Wikipedia explaining \"Rock paper scissors\" game:  $\\beta$\n\nAnswer:\n#\n#    ------------------------------------------------\n#           ____          _     Generatered using\n#          \/ ___|        | |\n#         | |    __ _  __| | ___ _ __  ______ _\n#         | |   \/ _` |\/ _` |\/ _ \\ '_ \\|_  \/ _` |\n#         | |__| (_| | (_| |  __\/ | | |\/ \/ (_| |\n#          \\____\\____|\\____|\\___|_| |_\/___\\____|\n#\n#      GNU Affero General Public License v3.0\n#    ------------------------------------------------\n#    Author   : prophet\n#    Created  : 2020-07-12 11:19:01.523119\n#    UUID     : aXsU7xuXyjk3Ky2f\n#    ------------------------------------------------\n#\nproduction = True\n\nimport sys, math, collections\n\ndef input(input_format = 0, multi = 0):\n\n    if multi > 0: return [input(input_format) for i in range(multi)]\n    else:\n        next_line = sys.stdin.readline()[:-1]\n\n        if input_format >= 10:\n            use_list = False\n            input_format = int(str(input_format)[-1])\n        else: use_list = True\n\n        if input_format == 0: formatted_input = [next_line]\n        elif input_format == 1: formatted_input = list(map(int, next_line.split()))\n        elif input_format == 2: formatted_input = list(map(float, next_line.split()))\n        elif input_format == 3: formatted_input = list(next_line)\n        elif input_format == 4: formatted_input = list(map(int, list(next_line)))\n        elif input_format == 5: formatted_input = next_line.split()\n        else: formatted_input = [next_line]\n\n        return formatted_input if use_list else formatted_input[0]\n\ndef out(output_line, output_format = 0, newline = True):\n\n    formatted_output = \"\"\n\n    if output_format == 0: formatted_output = str(output_line)\n    elif output_format == 1: formatted_output = \" \".join(map(str, output_line))\n    elif output_format == 2: formatted_output = \"\\n\".join(map(str, output_line))\n\n    print(formatted_output, end = \"\\n\" if newline else \"\")\n\ndef log(*args):\n    if not production:\n        print(\"$$$\", end = \"\")\n        print(*args)\n\nenu = enumerate\n\nter = lambda a, b, c: b if a else c\n\nceil = lambda a, b: -(-a \/\/ b)\n\ndef mapl(iterable, format = 0):\n    \n    if format == 0: return list(map(int, iterable))\n    elif format == 1: return list(map(str, iterable))\n    elif format == 2: return list(map(list, iterable))\n#\n#   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> START OF SOLUTION <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n#\n\n\ndef solve():\n\n    s = input(3)\n\n    u = [0] * 3\n\n    for i in s:\n        if i == \"R\":\n            u[0] += 1\n        elif i == \"P\":\n            u[1] += 1\n        elif i == \"S\":\n            u[2] += 1\n\n    log(u)\n    y = 0\n    p = 0\n\n    for i, j in enu(u):\n        if j > y:\n            y = j\n            p = i\n\n    if p == 0:\n        a = \"P\"\n    elif p == 1:\n        a = \"S\"\n    elif p == 2:\n        a = \"R\"\n\n    out(a * len(s))\n\n    return\n\n\nfor i in range(input(11)): solve()\n# solve()\n\n#\n#   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> END OF SOLUTION <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n#\n\nExample 2:\nThe Siruseri Singing Championship is going to start, and Lavanya wants to figure out the outcome before the tournament even begins! Looking at past tournaments, she realizes that the judges care only about the pitches that the singers can sing in, and so she devises a method through which she can accurately predict the outcome of a match between any two singers. \nShe represents various pitches as integers and has assigned a lower limit and an upper limit for each singer, which corresponds to their vocal range. For any singer, the lower limit will always be less than the upper limit. If a singer has lower limit $L$ and upper limit $U$ ($L < U$), it means that this particular singer can sing in all the pitches between $L$ and $U$, that is they can sing in the pitches {$L, L+1, L+2, \\ldots, U$}. \nThe lower bounds and upper bounds of all the singers are distinct. When two singers $S_i$ and $S_j$ with bounds ($L_i$, $U_i)$ and ($L_j$, $U_j$) compete against each other, $S_i$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_j$ can sing in, and some more pitches. Similarly, $S_j$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_i$ can sing in, and some more pitches. If neither of those two conditions are met, the match ends up as a draw. \n$N$ singers are competing in the tournament. Each singer competes in $N$-1 matches, one match against each of the other singers. The winner of a match scores 2 points, and the loser gets no points. But in case of a draw, both the singers get 1 point each.\nYou are given the lower and upper bounds of all the $N$ singers. You need to output the total scores of each of the $N$ singers at the end of the tournament.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of every testcase contains a single integer, $N$, which is the number of singers.\n- $N$ lines follow, the i-th of which contains two integers: $L_i$ and $U_i$, which correspond to the lower bound and upper bound of the i-th singer.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each testcase output a single line containing $N$ integers, the i-th of which should be score of the i-th singer at the end of the tournament. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 5$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le L_i < U_i \\le 10^9$\n- All the $2*N$ integers (lower bounds and upper bounds) are distinct.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (15 points): $1 \\le N \\le 10^3$\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- It is guaranteed that no match ends in a draw.\nSubtask #3 (60 points): Original constraints.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n3\n10 20\n13 18\n15 19\n3\n10 22\n13 21\n15 20\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4 1 1\n4 2 0\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 20), (13, 18) and (15, 19).\nWhen the first singer and second singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}. Whereas the first singer can sing in the pitches {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. So, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the second singer can, and also some other pitches. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The second singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the first singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. So again, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the third singer can. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The third singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the second singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}, whereas the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. In particular, the second singer can sing in the pitch 14, which the third singer cannot sing in. And the third singer can sing in the pitch 19, which the second singer cannot sing in. So neither of the two conditions are met, and hence this match ends in a draw. Both the second and third singer get 1 point each.\nThus at the end of the tournament, the total score of first player is 2 + 2 = 4.\nTotal score of the second player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nTotal score of the third player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nHence the output is 4 1 1\nTestcase 2: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 22), (13, 21) and (15, 20).\nWe see that the first singer wins against both second and third singers. And the second singer wins against the third singer. So the final total scores are (2 + 2), (0 + 2), (0 + 0), which is 4 2 0. Note that this would be a valid testcase in Subtask 2, because no match ends in a draw.\n\nAnswer:\n# cook your dish here\nfrom operator import itemgetter\nt=int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n=int(input())\n    start=[]\n    end=[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        first, last = map (int, input().split())\n        start.append((first, i))\n        end.append((last, i))\n    score=[0]*n \n    start.sort(key=itemgetter(0))\n    end.sort(key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        score[start[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n        score[end[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n    print(' '.join([str(i) for i in score]))\n\nQUESTION:\nRock-paper-scissors is a popular two-player game. In the game, each of the players uses their hand to show one of three symbols: rock, paper or scissors. If both players show the same symbol, the game is a tie. Otherwise, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock and rock beats scissors.\n\nSven has been studying the psychological intricacies of the game for years and has become a real master at the game, his friends not standing a chance against him in one-on-one games.\n\nWith the world championships around the corner, Sven is practicing his skills playing simultaneous games with $N$ of his friends. One such game consists of $R$ rounds. In each round, Sven and each of his friends show one of the three symbols.\n\nWhen calculating the score, in each round, Sven\u2019s symbol is independently compared to each of his friends\u2019 symbols. Sven scores two points for every win and one point for every tie. Sven does not get points for losing.\n\nWrite a program that calculates Sven\u2019s total score, and also his largest possible score had he known in advance all the symbols his friends would show.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le 50$), the number of rounds played.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019. The string represents symbols that Sven showed in each round. \u2018S\u2019 is for scissors, \u2018P\u2019 for paper, \u2018R\u2019 for rock.\n\nThe third line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 50$), the number of friends.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019.
