He has a checkered field of size n \u00d7 n cells, where m various cells are banned. Before the game, he has to put a few chips on some border (but not corner) board cells. Then for n - 1 minutes, Gerald every minute moves each chip into an adjacent cell. He moves each chip from its original edge to the opposite edge. Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases: At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell. At least once two chips were on the same cell. At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). In that case he loses and earns 0 points. When nothing like that happened, he wins and earns the number of points equal to the number of chips he managed to put on the boardHelp Gerald earn the most points. n, m = list(map(int, input().split())) used = [1] * 2 * n for i in range(m): x, y = list(map(int, input().split())) used[x - 1] = used[n + y - 1] = 0 if n % 2 and used[n // 2]: used[n // 2 + n] = 0 res = sum(used) for i in [0, n - 1, n, 2 * n - 1]: res -= used[i] print(res) Example 2: Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion. We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h \u00d7 w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?

The robot was not alone, and by coincidence he was very fond of the same country's painter. He happened to be wearing a kettle (kettle is a kettle, no need for explanation), which you are going to consider as his hideout. So when the painter decided to show him, he was being strapped with a kettle handle, and with your help he was to put the handle inside the chest.\n\nThe kettle handle was very long, so the painter wanted to use it in two hands, and he wanted you to calculate how many different positions could the kettle handle go on a kettle from each corner.\n\n\n [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014"], "assigned_process": 0, "assigned_model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base", "output_index": 4, "input_index": 1828}
