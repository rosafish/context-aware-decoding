You can't choose [-1] and delete -1 from it, then get an empty subarray to make the sum equals to 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:\n        ignore=0\n        not_ignore=0\n        res=-sys.maxsize\n        for i in arr:\n            if i>=0:\n                ignore+=i\n                not_ignore+=i\n            else:\n                if ignore==0:\n                    ignore+=i\n                else:\n                    ignore=max(ignore+i,not_ignore)\n                not_ignore+=i\n            res=max(res,ignore)\n            if ignore<0:\n                ignore=0\n            if not_ignore<0:\n                not_ignore=0\n        return res\n\n\nQUESTION:\nInna likes sweets and a game called the \"Candy Matrix\". Today, she came up with the new game \"Candy Matrix 2: Reload\".\n\nThe field for the new game is a rectangle table of size n \u00d7 m. Each line of the table contains one cell with a dwarf figurine, one cell with a candy, the other cells of the line are empty. The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout \"Let's go!\". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell. The movement continues until one of the following events occurs:\n\n  some dwarf in one of the chosen lines is located in the rightmost cell of his row;  some dwarf in the chosen lines is located in the cell with the candy. \n\nThe point of the game is to transport all the dwarves to the candy cells.\n\nInna is fabulous, as she came up with such an interesting game. But what about you? Your task is to play this game optimally well.

A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2i - 1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2i)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students i and j talk, then the i-th student's happiness increases by g_{ij} and the j-th student's happiness increases by g_{ji}. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows g_{ij} (0 \u2264 g_{ij} \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that g_{ii} = 0 for all i.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n32\n\nInput\n0 43 21 18 2\n3 0 21 11 65\n5 2 0 1 4\n54 62 12 0 99\n87 64 81 33 0\n\nOutput\n620\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154.

Then the testcases follow. \n- Each test case constitutes of Two lines. \n- First line contains $N$, representing the number of people left in the universe\n- The second line contains an array $a[i]$ of size $N$ containing heights of those $N$ people.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, you have to output a Single line Containing the minimum number of kills required by Rahul to eliminate the Universe.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 50000$\n- $100 \\leq a[i] \\leq 10^5$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n10\n178 184 178 177 171 173 171 183 171 175\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n5\n\nAnswer:\nfrom math import ceil\r\nt=int(input())\r\nfor i in range(t):\r\n       p=int(input())\r\n       l=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n       maxx=1\r\n       for i in range(len(l)):\r\n           maxx=max(maxx,l.count(l[i]))\r\n       if(maxx*2>p):\r\n           print(maxx)\r\n       else:\r\n           q=p-maxx*2\r\n           maxx+=ceil(q\/2)\r\n           print(maxx)\r\n           \r\n       \r\n              \r\n\r\n\n\nQUESTION:\nRock-paper-scissors is a popular two-player game. In the game, each of the players uses their hand to show one of three symbols: rock, paper or scissors. If both players show the same symbol, the game is a tie. Otherwise, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock and rock beats scissors.\n\nSven has been studying the psychological intricacies of the game for years and has become a real master at the game, his friends not standing a chance against him in one-on-one games.\n\nWith the world championships around the corner, Sven is practicing his skills playing simultaneous games with $N$ of his friends. One such game consists of $R$ rounds. In each round, Sven and each of his friends show one of the three symbols.\n\nWhen calculating the score, in each round, Sven\u2019s symbol is independently compared to each of his friends\u2019 symbols. Sven scores two points for every win and one point for every tie. Sven does not get points for losing.\n\nWrite a program that calculates Sven\u2019s total score, and also his largest possible score had he known in advance all the symbols his friends would show.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le 50$), the number of rounds played.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019. The string represents symbols that Sven showed in each round. \u2018S\u2019 is for scissors, \u2018P\u2019 for paper, \u2018R\u2019 for rock.\n\nThe third line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 50$), the number of friends.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019. These are the symbols shown by each of the $N$ friends in each of the $R$ rounds.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput Sven\u2019s actual score on the first line.\n\nOutput his largest possible score on the second line, assuming his friends didn\u2019t change their symbols.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\nSSPPR\n1\nSSPPR\nSample Output 1:\n5\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\nSSPPR\n2\nPPRRS\nRRSSP\nSample Output 2:\n10\n15\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":1}
