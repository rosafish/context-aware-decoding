In this version, $1 \\le n \\le 10^5$ and $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$. You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nChristmas is coming, and our protagonist, Bob, is preparing a spectacular present for his long-time best friend Alice. This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer $k > 1$ such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by $k$. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. \n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible. Therefore, he asks you to calculate the minimum number of seconds he would need to make Alice happy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of chocolate boxes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of chocolate pieces in the $i$-th box.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no way for Charlie to make Alice happy, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print a single integer $x$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of seconds for Charlie to help Bob make Alice happy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 0 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nAnswer:\n# \u7d20\u56e0\u6570\u5206\u89e3\ndef prime_decomposition(n):\n    i = 2\n    table = []\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            n \/\/= i\n            table.append(i)\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        table.append(n)\n    return table\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n# \u304b\u3051\u3089\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u3066\u5171\u901a\u56e0\u6570\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\nsu = sum(A)\nif su == 1:\n    print(-1)\n    return\nprimes = list(set(prime_decomposition(su)))\nans = float(\"inf\")\nIdx1 = [i for i, a in enumerate(A) if a]\n\nfor p in primes:\n    an = 0\n    half = p \/\/ 2\n    for t in zip(*[iter(Idx1)]*p):\n        idx = t[half]\n        an += sum(abs(i-idx) for i in t)\n    ans = min(ans, an)\nprint(ans)\n\n\nQUESTION:\nSakuzyo - Imprinting\n\nA.R.C.

We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h \u00d7 w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 \u2264 h, w \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000). \n\nNext n lines contain the description of black cells.

The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and n columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\n\n [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 for pretests and tests or t = 1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of t sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers n, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of n character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the k trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB......CCCCC\n........DDDDD...\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\n.......DDDDD....\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\nInput\n2\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n.....AAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n....AAAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row.

On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have prepared it, already do not work on it.\n\nFor example, if the Olympiad is held on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all seven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from December, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won't be working on the problems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can start preparing problems for some other Olympiad). And if the Olympiad is held on November 3rd and requires 5 days of training, the members of the jury will work from October 29th to November 2nd.\n\nIn order not to overload the jury the following rule was introduced: one member of the jury can not work on the same day on the tasks for different Olympiads. Write a program that determines what the minimum number of people must be part of the jury so that all Olympiads could be prepared in time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n \u2014 the number of Olympiads in 2013 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the following n lines contains four integers m_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} and t_{i} \u2014 the month and day of the Olympiad (given without leading zeroes), the needed number of the jury members and the time needed to prepare the i-th Olympiad (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 12, d_{i} \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 p_{i}, t_{i} \u2264 100), d_{i} doesn't exceed the number of days in month m_{i}. The Olympiads are given in the arbitrary order. Several Olympiads can take place in one day.\n\nUse the modern (Gregorian) calendar in the solution. Note that all dates are given in the year 2013.

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nGennady is one of the best child dentists in Berland. Today n children got an appointment with him, they lined up in front of his office.\n\nAll children love to cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with integers from 1 to n in the order they go in the line. Every child is associated with the value of his cofidence p_{i}. The children take turns one after another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first in the line goes to the doctor.\n\nWhile Gennady treats the teeth of the i-th child, the child is crying with the volume of v_{i}. At that the confidence of the first child in the line is reduced by the amount of v_{i}, the second one \u2014 by value v_{i} - 1, and so on. The children in the queue after the v_{i}-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the j-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of d_{j} and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the j-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of d_{j}.\n\nAll these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\n\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure. Print their numbers in the chronological order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000) \u2014 the number of kids in the line. \n\nNext n lines contain three integers each v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} (1 \u2264 v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry in the hall and the confidence of the i-th child.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print number k \u2014 the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure.\n\nIn the second line print k integers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will make it to the end of the line in the increasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 2 2\n4 1 2\n5 2 4\n3 3 5\n5 1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 3 \nInput\n5\n4 5 1\n5 3 9\n4 1 2\n2 1 8\n4 1 9\n\nOutput\n4\n1 2 4 5 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first child who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to  - 2, 1, 3, 1, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 2, 0. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.\n\nIn the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,  - 1, 6, 8. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5, 5, 7. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 3. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\nv = [ list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\n\nres = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\tif v[i][2] >= 0:\n\t\tres.append(i + 1)\n\t\tdec = 0\n\t\tfor j in range(i + 1, n):\n\t\t\tif v[j][2] >= 0:\n\t\t\t\tif v[i][0] > 0:\n\t\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= v[i][0]\n\t\t\t\t\tv[i][0] -= 1\n\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= dec\n\t\t\t\tif v[j][2] < 0: dec += v[j][1]\n\nprint(len(res))\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n\nQUESTION:\nMany students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2i - 1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2i)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students i and j talk, then the i-th student's happiness increases by g_{ij} and the j-th student's happiness increases by g_{ji}. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows g_{ij} (0 \u2264 g_{ij} \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that g_{ii} = 0 for all i.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n32\n\nInput\n0 43 21 18 2\n3 0 21 11 65\n5 2 0 1 4\n54 62 12 0 99\n87 64 81 33 0\n\nOutput\n620\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals:\n\n(g_23 + g_32 + g_15 + g_51) + (g_13 + g_31 + g_54 + g_45) + (g_15 + g_51) + (g_54 + g_45) = 32.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":1.5}

Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or \"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.\n\nJeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff find the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game if he moves optimally well.\n\nYou can consider that the coin shows the heads (or tails) with the probability of 50 percent.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000).

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nThe Siruseri Singing Championship is going to start, and Lavanya wants to figure out the outcome before the tournament even begins! Looking at past tournaments, she realizes that the judges care only about the pitches that the singers can sing in, and so she devises a method through which she can accurately predict the outcome of a match between any two singers. \nShe represents various pitches as integers and has assigned a lower limit and an upper limit for each singer, which corresponds to their vocal range. For any singer, the lower limit will always be less than the upper limit. If a singer has lower limit $L$ and upper limit $U$ ($L < U$), it means that this particular singer can sing in all the pitches between $L$ and $U$, that is they can sing in the pitches {$L, L+1, L+2, \\ldots, U$}. \nThe lower bounds and upper bounds of all the singers are distinct. When two singers $S_i$ and $S_j$ with bounds ($L_i$, $U_i)$ and ($L_j$, $U_j$) compete against each other, $S_i$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_j$ can sing in, and some more pitches. Similarly, $S_j$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_i$ can sing in, and some more pitches. If neither of those two conditions are met, the match ends up as a draw. \n$N$ singers are competing in the tournament. Each singer competes in $N$-1 matches, one match against each of the other singers. The winner of a match scores 2 points, and the loser gets no points. But in case of a draw, both the singers get 1 point each.\nYou are given the lower and upper bounds of all the $N$ singers. You need to output the total scores of each of the $N$ singers at the end of the tournament.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of every testcase contains a single integer, $N$, which is the number of singers.\n- $N$ lines follow, the i-th of which contains two integers: $L_i$ and $U_i$, which correspond to the lower bound and upper bound of the i-th singer.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each testcase output a single line containing $N$ integers, the i-th of which should be score of the i-th singer at the end of the tournament. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 5$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le L_i < U_i \\le 10^9$\n- All the $2*N$ integers (lower bounds and upper bounds) are distinct.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (15 points): $1 \\le N \\le 10^3$\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- It is guaranteed that no match ends in a draw.\nSubtask #3 (60 points): Original constraints.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n3\n10 20\n13 18\n15 19\n3\n10 22\n13 21\n15 20\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4 1 1\n4 2 0\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 20), (13, 18) and (15, 19).\nWhen the first singer and second singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}. Whereas the first singer can sing in the pitches {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. So, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the second singer can, and also some other pitches. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The second singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the first singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. So again, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the third singer can. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The third singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the second singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}, whereas the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. In particular, the second singer can sing in the pitch 14, which the third singer cannot sing in. And the third singer can sing in the pitch 19, which the second singer cannot sing in. So neither of the two conditions are met, and hence this match ends in a draw. Both the second and third singer get 1 point each.\nThus at the end of the tournament, the total score of first player is 2 + 2 = 4.\nTotal score of the second player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nTotal score of the third player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nHence the output is 4 1 1\nTestcase 2: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 22), (13, 21) and (15, 20).\nWe see that the first singer wins against both second and third singers. And the second singer wins against the third singer. So the final total scores are (2 + 2), (0 + 2), (0 + 0), which is 4 2 0. Note that this would be a valid testcase in Subtask 2, because no match ends in a draw.\n\nAnswer:\n# cook your dish here\nfrom operator import itemgetter\nt=int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n=int(input())\n    start=[]\n    end=[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        first, last = map (int, input().split())\n        start.append((first, i))\n        end.append((last, i))\n    score=[0]*n \n    start.sort(key=itemgetter(0))\n    end.sort(key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        score[start[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n        score[end[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n    print(' '.join([str(i) for i in score]))\n\nQUESTION:\nRock-paper-scissors is a popular two-player game.
