So, they just put one question in the test that is worth all the points.\n\nThere are n integers written on a row. Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains. The first operation should be addition.\n\nNote that, if she ended the previous row by adding the integers, she should start the next row by subtracting, and vice versa.\n\nThe teachers will simply look at the last integer, and then if it is correct, Karen gets a perfect score, otherwise, she gets a zero for the test.\n\nKaren has studied well for this test, but she is scared that she might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer to be wrong. If the process is followed, what number can she expect to be written on the last row?\n\nSince this number can be quite large, output only the non-negative remainder after dividing it by 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000), the number of numbers written on the first row.\n\nThe next line contains n integers.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through.

Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn.

At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought.

It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  \u2260  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.\n\nThe last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 \u2264 cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} \u2264 d - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n3 2\n3 1 3 2\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n10 10\n1 2 1 1\n5 5 6 5\n6 4 5 4\n2 1 2 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n2 2\n2 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. \n\nSo the second one corresponds to the given conditions.\n\nIn the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. \n\nAnd there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-1}
