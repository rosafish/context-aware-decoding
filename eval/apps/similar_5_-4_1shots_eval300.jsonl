In this version, $1 \\le n \\le 10^5$ and $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$. You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nChristmas is coming, and our protagonist, Bob, is preparing a spectacular present for his long-time best friend Alice. This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer $k > 1$ such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by $k$. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. \n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible. Therefore, he asks you to calculate the minimum number of seconds he would need to make Alice happy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of chocolate boxes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of chocolate pieces in the $i$-th box.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no way for Charlie to make Alice happy, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print a single integer $x$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of seconds for Charlie to help Bob make Alice happy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 0 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nAnswer:\n# \u7d20\u56e0\u6570\u5206\u89e3\ndef prime_decomposition(n):\n    i = 2\n    table = []\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            n \/\/= i\n            table.append(i)\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        table.append(n)\n    return table\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n# \u304b\u3051\u3089\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u3066\u5171\u901a\u56e0\u6570\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\nsu = sum(A)\nif su == 1:\n    print(-1)\n    return\nprimes = list(set(prime_decomposition(su)))\nans = float(\"inf\")\nIdx1 = [i for i, a in enumerate(A) if a]\n\nfor p in primes:\n    an = 0\n    half = p \/\/ 2\n    for t in zip(*[iter(Idx1)]*p):\n        idx = t[half]\n        an += sum(abs(i-idx) for i in t)\n    ans = min(ans, an)\nprint(ans)\n\n\nQUESTION:\nSakuzyo - Imprinting\n\nA.R.C.

We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h \u00d7 w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 \u2264 h, w \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000). \n\nNext n lines contain the description of black cells.

The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and n columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\n\n [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 for pretests and tests or t = 1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of t sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers n, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of n character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the k trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB......CCCCC\n........DDDDD...\n16 4\n...AAAAA........\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\n.......DDDDD....\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\nInput\n2\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n.....AAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n10 4\ns.ZZ......\n....AAAABB\n.YYYYYY...\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset.\n\nAnswer:\ndef dfs(x, y):\n    vis.append((x, y))\n    y += 1\n    nonlocal flag\n    if flag or str.isalpha(grid[x][y]):\n        return\n    if y >= n - 1:\n        flag = True\n        return\n    \n    # stay idle\n    if not str.isalpha(grid[x][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x][y + 2]) and (x, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x, y + 2)\n\n    # move down\n    if x > 0 and  not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x - 1][y + 2]) and (x - 1, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x - 1, y + 2)\n\n    #move up\n    if x < 2 and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y + 1]) and not str.isalpha(grid[x + 1][y + 2]) and (x + 1, y + 2) not in vis:\n        dfs(x + 1, y + 2)\n    \n\nT = int(input())\nfor loop in range(T):\n    n, k = [ int(i) for i in input().split() ]\n    grid = list()\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    grid.append(input() + \"    \")\n    vis = list()\n    flag = False\n    for i in  range(3):\n        if grid[i][0] == 's':\n            grid[i] = \" \" + grid[i][1:]\n            dfs(i, 0)\n            break\n    if flag:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nQUESTION:\nMaria participates in a bicycle race.\n\nThe speedway takes place on the shores of Lake Lucerne, just repeating its contour.

On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have prepared it, already do not work on it.\n\nFor example, if the Olympiad is held on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all seven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from December, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won't be working on the problems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can start preparing problems for some other Olympiad). And if the Olympiad is held on November 3rd and requires 5 days of training, the members of the jury will work from October 29th to November 2nd.\n\nIn order not to overload the jury the following rule was introduced: one member of the jury can not work on the same day on the tasks for different Olympiads. Write a program that determines what the minimum number of people must be part of the jury so that all Olympiads could be prepared in time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n \u2014 the number of Olympiads in 2013 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the following n lines contains four integers m_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} and t_{i} \u2014 the month and day of the Olympiad (given without leading zeroes), the needed number of the jury members and the time needed to prepare the i-th Olympiad (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 12, d_{i} \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 p_{i}, t_{i} \u2264 100), d_{i} doesn't exceed the number of days in month m_{i}. The Olympiads are given in the arbitrary order. Several Olympiads can take place in one day.\n\nUse the modern (Gregorian) calendar in the solution. Note that all dates are given in the year 2013.

You may consult the following example coding questions and their answers to provide the code. Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nGennady is one of the best child dentists in Berland. Today n children got an appointment with him, they lined up in front of his office.\n\nAll children love to cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with integers from 1 to n in the order they go in the line. Every child is associated with the value of his cofidence p_{i}. The children take turns one after another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first in the line goes to the doctor.\n\nWhile Gennady treats the teeth of the i-th child, the child is crying with the volume of v_{i}. At that the confidence of the first child in the line is reduced by the amount of v_{i}, the second one \u2014 by value v_{i} - 1, and so on. The children in the queue after the v_{i}-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the j-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of d_{j} and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the j-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of d_{j}.\n\nAll these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\n\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure. Print their numbers in the chronological order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000) \u2014 the number of kids in the line. \n\nNext n lines contain three integers each v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} (1 \u2264 v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry in the hall and the confidence of the i-th child.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print number k \u2014 the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure.\n\nIn the second line print k integers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will make it to the end of the line in the increasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 2 2\n4 1 2\n5 2 4\n3 3 5\n5 1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 3 \nInput\n5\n4 5 1\n5 3 9\n4 1 2\n2 1 8\n4 1 9\n\nOutput\n4\n1 2 4 5 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first child who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to  - 2, 1, 3, 1, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 2, 0. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.\n\nIn the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,  - 1, 6, 8. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5, 5, 7. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 3. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\n\nn = int(input())\n\nv = [ list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\n\nres = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\tif v[i][2] >= 0:\n\t\tres.append(i + 1)\n\t\tdec = 0\n\t\tfor j in range(i + 1, n):\n\t\t\tif v[j][2] >= 0:\n\t\t\t\tif v[i][0] > 0:\n\t\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= v[i][0]\n\t\t\t\t\tv[i][0] -= 1\n\t\t\t\tv[j][2] -= dec\n\t\t\t\tif v[j][2] < 0: dec += v[j][1]\n\nprint(len(res))\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n\nQUESTION:\nMany students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2i - 1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2i)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students i and j talk, then the i-th student's happiness increases by g_{ij} and the j-th student's happiness increases by g_{ji}. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows g_{ij} (0 \u2264 g_{ij} \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that g_{ii} = 0 for all i.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n32\n\nInput\n0 43 21 18 2\n3 0 21 11 65\n5 2 0 1 4\n54 62 12 0 99\n87 64 81 33 0\n\nOutput\n620\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals:\n\n(g_23 + g_32 + g_15 + g_51) + (g_13 + g_31 + g_54 + g_45) + (g_15 + g_51) + (g_54 + g_45) = 32.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or \"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.\n\nJeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff find the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game if he moves optimally well.\n\nYou can consider that the coin shows the heads (or tails) with the probability of 50 percent.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000).

Looking at past tournaments, she realizes that the judges care only about the pitches that the singers can sing in, and so she devises a method through which she can accurately predict the outcome of a match between any two singers. \nShe represents various pitches as integers and has assigned a lower limit and an upper limit for each singer, which corresponds to their vocal range. For any singer, the lower limit will always be less than the upper limit. If a singer has lower limit $L$ and upper limit $U$ ($L < U$), it means that this particular singer can sing in all the pitches between $L$ and $U$, that is they can sing in the pitches {$L, L+1, L+2, \\ldots, U$}. \nThe lower bounds and upper bounds of all the singers are distinct. When two singers $S_i$ and $S_j$ with bounds ($L_i$, $U_i)$ and ($L_j$, $U_j$) compete against each other, $S_i$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_j$ can sing in, and some more pitches. Similarly, $S_j$ wins if they can sing in every pitch that $S_i$ can sing in, and some more pitches. If neither of those two conditions are met, the match ends up as a draw. \n$N$ singers are competing in the tournament. Each singer competes in $N$-1 matches, one match against each of the other singers. The winner of a match scores 2 points, and the loser gets no points. But in case of a draw, both the singers get 1 point each.\nYou are given the lower and upper bounds of all the $N$ singers. You need to output the total scores of each of the $N$ singers at the end of the tournament.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of every testcase contains a single integer, $N$, which is the number of singers.\n- $N$ lines follow, the i-th of which contains two integers: $L_i$ and $U_i$, which correspond to the lower bound and upper bound of the i-th singer.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each testcase output a single line containing $N$ integers, the i-th of which should be score of the i-th singer at the end of the tournament. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 5$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le L_i < U_i \\le 10^9$\n- All the $2*N$ integers (lower bounds and upper bounds) are distinct.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (15 points): $1 \\le N \\le 10^3$\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- It is guaranteed that no match ends in a draw.\nSubtask #3 (60 points): Original constraints.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n3\n10 20\n13 18\n15 19\n3\n10 22\n13 21\n15 20\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4 1 1\n4 2 0\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 20), (13, 18) and (15, 19).\nWhen the first singer and second singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}. Whereas the first singer can sing in the pitches {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. So, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the second singer can, and also some other pitches. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The second singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the first singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. So again, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the third singer can. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The third singer gets no points from this match.\nWhen the second singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}, whereas the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. In particular, the second singer can sing in the pitch 14, which the third singer cannot sing in. And the third singer can sing in the pitch 19, which the second singer cannot sing in. So neither of the two conditions are met, and hence this match ends in a draw. Both the second and third singer get 1 point each.\nThus at the end of the tournament, the total score of first player is 2 + 2 = 4.\nTotal score of the second player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nTotal score of the third player is 0 + 1 = 1.\nHence the output is 4 1 1\nTestcase 2: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 22), (13, 21) and (15, 20).\nWe see that the first singer wins against both second and third singers. And the second singer wins against the third singer. So the final total scores are (2 + 2), (0 + 2), (0 + 0), which is 4 2 0. Note that this would be a valid testcase in Subtask 2, because no match ends in a draw.\n\nAnswer:\n# cook your dish here\nfrom operator import itemgetter\nt=int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n=int(input())\n    start=[]\n    end=[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        first, last = map (int, input().split())\n        start.append((first, i))\n        end.append((last, i))\n    score=[0]*n \n    start.sort(key=itemgetter(0))\n    end.sort(key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        score[start[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n        score[end[i][1]]+=n-i-1\n    print(' '.join([str(i) for i in score]))\n\nQUESTION:\nRock-paper-scissors is a popular two-player game.

He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time.

Before the robot puts a number x to the basket, Misha should answer the question: is it possible to choose one or multiple numbers that already are in the basket, such that their XOR sum equals x? \n\nIf the answer is positive, you also need to give the indexes of these numbers. If there are multiple options of choosing numbers, you are allowed to choose any correct option. After Misha's answer the robot puts the number to the basket.\n\nInitially the basket is empty. Each integer you put in the basket takes some number.

Next he wants Sherlock to build a flower in the following way:\n\nHe puts both strings perpendicular to each other in such a way that they overlap at the same character. For example, if he has two strings \"ABCDEF\" and \"XXBCZQ\", one possible way to make a flower is:\n\nLength of petals in the above flower are 2, 2, 3 and 3.\nA flower's ugliness is sum of absolute difference of adjacent petal lengths i.e. i.e. if adjacent petal lengths are L1, L2, L3, L4, then ugliness of flower is |L1 - L2| + |L2 - L3| + |L3 - L4| + |L4 - L1|. \nSherlock wants to find minimum value of ugliness if we consider all possible flower configurations. Note that a configuration is valid even if any of the petal length is 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case consists of string S1 in one line followed by string S2 in the next line. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one possible way to make a flower.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output in one line the required answer.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n- 1 \u2264 length(S1), length(S2) \u2264 105\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\nABCDE\nXXBCZQ\nBBB\nBBBBBB\n\nOutput: \n2\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\n\nTest case 1:\n\nIf we keep the configuration shown in statement, the ugliness is 2, which is minimum possible.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nOne of the best configurations is\n\nB \nB B B  B  B B\nB\n\nwhere petal lengths are 1, 3, 1, 2.\n\nAnswer:\nfor _ in range(eval(input())):\n    S1=input()\n    m1=len(S1)\/2\n\n    S2=input()\n    m2=len(S2)\/2\n    d1={}\n    d2={}\n    for i in range(len(S1)):\n        c=S1[i]\n        v=abs(m1-i)\n        if c in d1:\n            if v<d1[c][0]:\n                d1[c]=[v,i]\n        else:\n            d1[c]=[v,i]\n    for i in range(len(S2)):\n        c=S2[i]\n        v=abs(m2-i)\n        if c in d2:\n            if v<d2[c][0]:\n                d2[c]=[v,i]\n        else:\n            d2[c]=[v,i]\n\n    mini=999999999999999999999999999999999\n    for i in d1:\n        if i in d2:\n            L1=d1[i][1]\n            L3=len(S1)-L1-1\n            L2=d2[i][1]\n            L4=len(S2)-L2-1\n            v=abs(L1-L2)+abs(L2-L3)+abs(L3-L4)+abs(L4-L1)\n            if v<mini:\n                mini=v\n    print(mini)\n\nQUESTION:\nYou will receive 5 points for solving this problem.\n\nManao has invented a new operation on strings that is called folding. Each fold happens between a pair of consecutive letters and places the second part of the string above first part, running in the opposite direction and aligned to the position of the fold. Using this operation, Manao converts the string into a structure that has one more level than there were fold operations performed. See the following examples for clarity.\n\nWe will denote the positions of folds with '|' characters. For example, the word \"ABRACADABRA\" written as \"AB|RACA|DAB|RA\" indicates that it has been folded three times: first, between the leftmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters; second, between 'A' and 'D'; and third, between the rightmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters. Here are several examples of folded strings:\n\n\"ABCDEF|GHIJK\" |  \"A|BCDEFGHIJK\" |  \"AB|RACA|DAB|RA\" |  \"X|XXXXX|X|X|XXXXXX\"\n\n               |                 |                   |       XXXXXX\n\n    KJIHG      |   KJIHGFEDCB    |      AR           |       X\n\n   ABCDEF      |            A    |     DAB           |       X\n\n               |                 |     ACAR          |       XXXXX\n\n               |                 |       AB          |           X\n\n\n\nOne last example for \"ABCD|EFGH|IJ|K\": \n\n K\n\nIJ\n\nHGFE\n\nABCD\n\n\n\nManao noticed that each folded string can be viewed as several piles of letters. For instance, in the previous example, there are four piles, which can be read as \"AHI\", \"BGJK\", \"CF\", and \"DE\" from bottom to top. Manao wonders what is the highest pile of identical letters he can build using fold operations on a given word. Note that the pile should not contain gaps and should start at the bottom level. For example, in the rightmost of the four examples above, none of the piles would be considered valid since each of them has gaps, starts above the bottom level, or both.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input will consist of one line containing a single string of n characters with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000 and no spaces. All characters of the string will be uppercase letters.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 5 points for the correct submission.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the size of the largest pile composed of identical characters that can be seen in a valid result of folding operations on the given string.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nABRACADABRA\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\nABBBCBDB\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\nAB\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example.

That's why he decided to make himself a new one following a certain algorithm.\n\nSereja takes a blank piece of paper. Then he starts writing out the sequence in m stages. Each time he either adds a new number to the end of the sequence or takes l first elements of the current sequence and adds them c times to the end. More formally, if we represent the current sequence as a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, then after we apply the described operation, the sequence transforms into a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}[, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l}] (the block in the square brackets must be repeated c times). \n\nA day has passed and Sereja has completed the sequence. He wonders what are the values of some of its elements. Help Sereja.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stages to build a sequence. \n\nNext m lines contain the description of the stages in the order they follow. The first number in the line is a type of stage (1 or 2). Type 1 means adding one number to the end of the sequence, in this case the line contains integer x_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number to add. Type 2 means copying a prefix of length l_{i} to the end c_{i} times, in this case the line further contains two integers l_{i}, c_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^4), l_{i} is the length of the prefix, c_{i} is the number of copyings. It is guaranteed that the length of prefix l_{i} is never larger than the current length of the sequence.\n\nThe next line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements Sereja is interested in. The next line contains the numbers of elements of the final sequence Sereja is interested in. The numbers are given in the strictly increasing order. It is guaranteed that all numbers are strictly larger than zero and do not exceed the length of the resulting sequence. Consider the elements of the final sequence numbered starting from 1 from the beginning to the end of the sequence.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the elements that Sereja is interested in, in the order in which their numbers occur in the input. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 1\n1 2\n2 2 1\n1 3\n2 5 2\n1 4\n16\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nOutput\n1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 4\n\nAnswer:\nn=int(input())\na=[]\nfor i in range(n):\n    a.append(list(map(int,input().split())))\nm=int(input())\nb=list(map(lambda x:int(x)-1,input().split()))\nc=[]\nnow=0\nk=0\nans=[]\nfor i in range(n):\n    t=a[i]\n    last=now\n    if t[0]==1:\n        now+=1\n        if len(c)<100000: c.append(t[1])\n        if k<m and b[k]==now-1: \n            ans.append(t[1])\n            k+=1\n    else:\n        now+=t[1]*t[2]\n        while t[2]:\n            if len(c)<100000: c.extend(c[:t[1]])\n            else: break\n            t[2]-=1\n        while k<m and last<=b[k]<now:\n            ans.append(c[(b[k]-last)%t[1]])\n            k+=1    \nfor i in range(m):\n    print(ans[i],end=' ')\n\n\nQUESTION:\nLittle Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store.

There are n + m inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to n from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting of q turns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.\n\nArtem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip! Help Artem find any initial matrix that will match the experiment results. It is guaranteed that experiment data is consistent, which means at least one valid matrix exists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively.\n\nNext q lines contain turns descriptions, one per line.

For the operation of first and second type integer r_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n) or c_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 m) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integers r_{i}, c_{i} and x_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 m,  - 10^9 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9) are given.\n\nOperation of the first type (t_{i} = 1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to row r_{i}, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (t_{i} = 2) means that column c_{i} will shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the row r_{i} and column c_{i} stores value x_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the description of any valid initial matrix as n lines containing m integers each.

The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n and d (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 10^3 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stations and the constant from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains n - 2 integers: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations.

Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.\n\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline.

He has recently come up with a new algorithm, which receives a string as an input. Let's represent the input string of the algorithm as q = q_1q_2... q_{k}. The algorithm consists of two steps:\n\n  Find any continuous subsequence (substring) of three characters of string q, which doesn't equal to either string \"zyx\", \"xzy\", \"yxz\". If q doesn't contain any such subsequence, terminate the algorithm, otherwise go to step 2.  Rearrange the letters of the found subsequence randomly and go to step 1. \n\nSereja thinks that the algorithm works correctly on string q if there is a non-zero probability that the algorithm will be terminated. But if the algorithm anyway will work for infinitely long on a string, then we consider the algorithm to work incorrectly on this string.\n\nSereja wants to test his algorithm. For that, he has string s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, consisting of n characters. The boy conducts a series of m tests.

Today he has invented a new algorithm just for you. Vitaly's algorithm works with string s, consisting of characters \"x\" and \"y\", and uses two following operations at runtime:  Find two consecutive characters in the string, such that the first of them equals \"y\", and the second one equals \"x\" and swap them. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string.  Find in the string two consecutive characters, such that the first of them equals \"x\" and the second one equals \"y\". Remove these characters from the string. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string. \n\nThe input for the new algorithm is string s, and the algorithm works as follows:  If you can apply at least one of the described operations to the string, go to step 2 of the algorithm. Otherwise, stop executing the algorithm and print the current string.  If you can apply operation 1, then apply it. Otherwise, apply operation 2. After you apply the operation, go to step 1 of the algorithm. \n\nNow Vitaly wonders, what is going to be printed as the result of the algorithm's work, if the input receives string s.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the string only consists of characters \"x\" and \"y\". It is guaranteed that the string consists of at most 10^6 characters. It is guaranteed that as the result of the algorithm's execution won't be an empty string.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the string that is printed as the result of the algorithm's work, if the input of the algorithm input receives string s.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nx\n\nOutput\nx\n\nInput\nyxyxy\n\nOutput\ny\n\nInput\nxxxxxy\n\nOutput\nxxxx\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test the algorithm will end after the first step of the algorithm, as it is impossible to apply any operation. Thus, the string won't change.\n\nIn the second test the transformation will be like this:  string \"yxyxy\" transforms into string \"xyyxy\";  string \"xyyxy\" transforms into string \"xyxyy\";  string \"xyxyy\" transforms into string \"xxyyy\";  string \"xxyyy\" transforms into string \"xyy\";  string \"xyy\" transforms into string \"y\". \n\nAs a result, we've got string \"y\". \n\nIn the third test case only one transformation will take place: string \"xxxxxy\" transforms into string \"xxxx\". Thus, the answer will be string \"xxxx\".\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

These integers must satisfy $x_1 = a$, $x_k = b$, and that the sequence $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k$ is $m$-cute.\n\nIt can be shown that under the problem constraints, for each query either no $m$-cute sequence exists, or there exists one with at most $50$ terms.\n\nIf there are multiple possible sequences, you may print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n5 26 2\n3 9 1\n\nOutput\n4 5 6 13 26\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the sample. In the first query, the sequence $5, 6, 13, 26$ is valid since $6 = 5 + \\bf{\\color{blue} 1}$, $13 = 6 + 5 + {\\bf\\color{blue} 2}$ and $26 = 13 + 6 + 5 + {\\bf\\color{blue} 2}$ have the bold values all between $1$ and $2$, so the sequence is $2$-cute. Other valid sequences, such as $5, 7, 13, 26$ are also accepted.\n\nIn the second query, the only possible $1$-cute sequence starting at $3$ is $3, 4, 8, 16, \\dots$, which does not contain $9$.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

Recently the government decided to set up a nationwide fiber-optic network to take Siruseri into the digital age. And as usual, this decision was implemented in a capital centric manner --- from each city in the country, a fiber optic cable was laid to the capital! Thus, traffic between any two cities had to go through the capital.\nSoon, it became apparent that this was not quite a clever idea, since any breakdown at the capital resulted in the disconnection of services between other cities. So, in the second phase, the government plans to connect a few more pairs of cities directly by fiber-optic cables. The government has specified that this is to be done in such a way that the disruption of services at any one city will still leave the rest of the country connected.\nThe government has data on the cost of laying fiber optic cables between every pair of cities. You task is to compute the minimum cost of additional cabling required to ensure the requirement described above is met.\nFor example, if Siruseri has $4$ cities numbered $1,2,3$ and $4$ where $1$ is the capital and further suppose that the cost of laying cables between these cities are as given in the table below:\n\nNote that the government has already connected the capital with every other city. So, if we connect the cities $2$ and $3$ as well as $3$ and $4$, you can check that disruption of service at any one city will still leave the other cities connected. The cost of connecting these two pairs is $4 + 6 = 10$. The same effect could have been achieved by connecting $2$ and $3$ as well as $2$ and $4$, which would have cost $4 + 5 = 9$. You can check that this is the best you can do.\nYour task is to write a program that allows the government to determine the minimum cost it has to incur in laying additional cables to fulfil the requirement.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of cities in Siruseri. You may assume that the capital city is always numbered $1$. \n- This is followed by $N$ lines of input each containing $N$ integers. \n- The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i$ is the cost of connecting city $i$ with city $j$.

Skylar had scolded friends and family for flying, heavily handing out the recent Swedish export flygskam (verbatim translation: flight shame). But alas, the things we do for love! Now they want your help to calculate the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe. \n\nTo calculate the best route you models the planet as a perfect sphere and assumes that all flights fly at the distance $6381$ km from the center of the earth. The amount of shame for a single point-to-point flight is calculated as the distance between the airports in km, plus a take-off and landing penalty of $100$, that is, two airports with the flight distance $1000$ km will result in $1100$ shame.\n\n-----Latitude and longitude-----\nThe positions of the airports are given as the latitude and longitude in (decimal) degrees. The latitude of a point $P$ on the earths surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing through $P$ and the center of the earth. The equator has latitude $0^\\circ $, points north of the equator has positive values and points south of the equator has negative values, the North Pole has latitude $90^\\circ $ and the South Pole latitude $-90 ^\\circ $. Half circles that run from the North to the South pole are called meridians. The zero meridian runs through Greenwich. The longitude of a point $Q$ is the angle between the zero meridian plane and the line that run through $Q$ and the center of the earth, with values from $- 180^\\circ $ to $+180^\\circ $, with positive values east of Greenwich.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with one line with two integers $1 \\leq N \\leq 10000$, the number of airports and $1 \\leq M \\leq 100000$, the number of two-way flight routes. The second line has two strings $S$ and $T$, Skylar\u2019s start position and Skylar\u2019s target position. Then follows $N$ lines, each starts with a three letter (uppercase) airport code, followed by two real values numbers, the latitude and longitude in degrees. Then follows $M$ lines, each with two strings $a$ and $b$, the airports with a two-way flight connection.\n\nAll flight airports have unique names and all connections are between existing airports.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a real value with the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will obtain on a one-way trip. If the target is unreachable and Skylar will be forever alone, output -1. Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 4\nARN SCR\nARN 59.6467921 17.9370443\nSCR 61.156603 12.837360\nCPH 55.618023 12.650763\nOSL 60.197646 11.100008\nARN OSL\nARN CPH\nSCR OSL\nOSL CPH\nSample Output 1:\n729.09706162045\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 1\nLAX AKL\nAKL -37.006131 174.783781\nLAX 33.941589 -118.408531\nLAX AKL\nSample Output 2:\n10603.3297338597\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nYou have a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.\n\nYou can perform operations on the string. Each operation consists of two steps:  select an integer $i$ from $1$ to the length of the string $s$, then delete the character $s_i$ (the string length gets reduced by $1$, the indices of characters to the right of the deleted one also get reduced by $1$);  if the string $s$ is not empty, delete the maximum length prefix consisting of the same characters (the indices of the remaining characters and the string length get reduced by the length of the deleted prefix). \n\nNote that both steps are mandatory in each operation, and their order cannot be changed.\n\nFor example, if you have a string $s =$ 111010, the first operation can be one of the following:  select $i = 1$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11010 $\\rightarrow$ 010;  select $i = 2$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11010 $\\rightarrow$ 010;  select $i = 3$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11010 $\\rightarrow$ 010;  select $i = 4$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11110 $\\rightarrow$ 0;  select $i = 5$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11100 $\\rightarrow$ 00;  select $i = 6$: we'll get 111010 $\\rightarrow$ 11101 $\\rightarrow$ 01. \n\nYou finish performing operations when the string $s$ becomes empty. What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line contains string $s$ of $n$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of operations you can perform.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n6\n111010\n1\n0\n1\n1\n2\n11\n6\n101010\n\nOutput\n3\n1\n1\n1\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, you can, for example, select $i = 2$ and get string 010 after the first operation. After that, you can select $i = 3$ and get string 1.

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nA key feature of the Siruseri railway network is that it has exactly one route between any pair of stations.\nThe government has chosen three contractors to run the canteens at the stations on the railway network. To ensure that there are no disputes between the contractors it has been decided that if two stations, say $A$ and $B$, are assigned to a particular contractor then all the stations that lie on the route from $A$ to $B$ will also be awarded to the same contractor.\nThe government would like the assignment of stations to the contractors to be as equitable as possible. The government has data on the number of passengers who pass through each station each year. They would like to assign stations so that the maximum number of passengers passing through any contractor's collection of stations is minimized.\nFor instance, suppose the railway network is as follows, where the volume of passenger traffic is indicated by the side of each station.\n\nOne possible assignment would to award stations $1$ and $3$ to one contractor (there by giving him a traffic of $35$ passengers), station $2$ to the second contractor (traffic of $20$) and stations $4, 5$ and $6$ to the third contractor (traffic of $100$). In this assignment, the maximum traffic for any one contractor is 100. On the other hand if we assigned stations $1, 2$ and $3$ to one contractor, station $4$ and $6$ to the second contractor and station $5$ to the third contractor the maximum traffic for any one contractor is $70$. You can check that you cannot do better. (The assignment $1$, $2$ and $3$ to one contractor, $4$ to the second contractor, and $5$ and $6$ to the third contractor has a lower value for the maximum traffic ($55$) but it is not a valid assignment as the route from $5$ to $6$ passes through $4$.)\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,..., N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2,3,...,N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2 \\cdot N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should be a single integer, corresponding to the minimum possible value of the maximum traffic of any contractor among all valid assignment of the stations to the three contractors.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 3000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\n10\n20\n25\n40\n30\n30\n4 5\n1 3\n3 4\n2 3\n6 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n70\n\nAnswer:\nn=int(input())\r\ncost=[]\r\nd={}\r\nval_desc=[0]*n\r\nvisited=set()\r\nvisited.add(0)\r\ndfstack=[]\r\ndesc = [[False for i in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n\tcost.append(int(input()))\r\n\td[i]=[]\r\n\r\nfor i in range(n-1):\r\n\tj,k=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\td[j-1].append(k-1)\r\n\td[k-1].append(j-1)\r\n\r\ndef dfs(u):\r\n\tval_desc[u]+=cost[u]\r\n\tdfstack.append(u)\r\n\tfor i in dfstack:\r\n\t\tdesc[u][i]=True\r\n\tfor i in d[u]:\r\n\t\tif i not in visited:\r\n\t\t\tvisited.add(i)\r\n\t\t\tdfs(i)\r\n\t\t\tval_desc[u]+=val_desc[i]\t\t\t\r\n\tdfstack.pop(-1)\r\n\r\ndfs(0)\r\nmp=10**9\r\ncoco=sum(cost)\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n\tfor j in range(i+1,n):\r\n\t\tvali=val_desc[i]\r\n\t\tvalj=val_desc[j]\r\n\t\tif desc[i][j]:\r\n\t\t\tvalj-=val_desc[i]\r\n\t\tif desc[j][i]:\r\n\t\t\tvali-=val_desc[j]\r\n\t\tp=max(vali,valj,coco-vali-valj)\r\n\t\tmp=min(mp,p)\r\n#print(desc)\r\n#print(val_desc)\r\n#print\r\nprint(mp)\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\n\nQUESTION:\nYour factory has $N$ junctions (numbered from $1$ to $N$) connected by $M$ conveyor belts. Each conveyor belt transports any product automatically from one junction to another junction in exactly one minute. Note that each conveyor belt only works in one direction. There can be more than one conveyor belt connecting two junctions, and there can be a conveyor belt connecting a junction to itself.\n\nThere are $K$ producers (machines which produce the products) located at the first $K$ junctions, i.e. junctions $1, 2, \\ldots , K$. The producer at junction $j$ produces an product each minute $(x \\cdot K + j)$ for all integers $x \\ge 0$ and $j = 1, 2, \\ldots , K$. All products are transported immediately via the conveyor belts to the warehouse at junction $N$, except for those produced at junction $N$ (if any). Items produced at junction $N$ are directly delivered to the warehouse (there is no need to use the conveyor belts).\n\nAt each junction, there is a robot deciding which conveyor belts the incoming product should go to in a negligible time (instantly). The robots can be programmed such that all products produced by a producer are always delivered to the warehouse via the same route. Once the robots are programmed, the routing can no longer be changed. Items from different producers may have the same or different routes.\n\nA prudent potential investor comes and wants to inspect the factory before making any decision. You want to show to the potential investor that your factory employs a good risk management policy. Thus, you want to make sure that each conveyor belt only transports at most one product at any time; i.e. two products cannot be on the same conveyor belt at the same time. On the other hand, there is no limit on the number of products at the junctions (the robots have a lot of arms!). To achieve this, you may turn off zero or more producers, but you still want to maximize the production, hence, this problem.\n\nFind the maximum number of producers that can be left running such that all the produced products can be delivered to the warehouse and each conveyor belt transports at most $1$ product at any time.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $M$ ($1 \\le K \\le N \\le 300$; $0 \\le M \\le 1000$) representing the number of junctions, the number of producers, and the number of conveyor belts, respectively.\n\nThe next $M$ lines, each contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le N$) representing a conveyor belt connecting junction $a$ and junction $b$ with the direction from $a$ to $b$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains an integer denoting the maximum number of producers which can be left running such that all the produced products can be delivered to the warehouse and each conveyor belt transports at most one product at any time.\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn Sample Input $1$, $N = 4$, $K = 2$, $M = 3$, and the directed edges are $\\{ (1,3)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)\\} $.

Both producers are using conveyor belt $(3,4)$, however, the products from producer $1$ are on the conveyor belt $(3,4)$ on minutes $2, 4, 6, \\dots $ (even minutes), while the products from producer $2$ are on the conveyor belt $(3,4)$ on minutes $3, 5, 7, \\dots $ (odd minutes). Therefore, both producers can be left running.\n\nIn Sample Input $2$, $N = 5$, $K = 2$, $M = 4$, and the directed edges are $\\{ (1,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(2,4)$, $(4,5)\\} $.

Under the terms of the discount system, in addition to the items in the cart the customer can receive at most two items from the supermarket for free. The number of the \"free items\" (0, 1 or 2) to give is selected by the customer. The only condition imposed on the selected \"free items\" is as follows: each of them mustn't be more expensive than the cheapest item out of the q_{i} items in the cart.\n\nMaxim now needs to buy n items in the shop. Count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well.\n\nPlease assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions.

You asked the local Panda-breed brewmaster for the recipe, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t know either. Instead, he gave you the mysterious tome titled The Root of all Evil (written by Halim the White). You read the evil book under candle light, and wrote down all the potion recipes contained inside the book. \u201cOne of them must be the formula for the mind control potion, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d, you said to yourself.

The rules follow.\n\nA positive integer $a$ is initially on the screen. The player can put a coin into the machine and then add $1$ to or subtract $1$ from any two adjacent digits. All digits must remain from $0$ to $9$ after this operation, and the leading digit must not equal zero. In other words, it is forbidden to add $1$ to $9$, to subtract $1$ from $0$ and to subtract $1$ from the leading $1$. Once the number on the screen becomes equal to $b$, the player wins the jackpot. $a$ and $b$ have the same number of digits.\n\nHelp the player to determine the minimal number of coins he needs to spend in order to win the jackpot and tell how to play.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) standing for the length of numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe next two lines contain numbers $a$ and $b$, each one on a separate line ($10^{n-1} \\le a, b < 10^n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to win the jackpot, print a single integer $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, the first line must contain the minimal possible number $c$ of coins the player has to spend.\n\n$\\min(c, 10^5)$ lines should follow, $i$-th of them containing two integers $d_i$ and $s_i$ ($1\\le d_i\\le n - 1$, $s_i = \\pm 1$) denoting that on the $i$-th step the player should add $s_i$ to the $d_i$-th and $(d_i + 1)$-st digits from the left (e. g. $d_i = 1$ means that two leading digits change while $d_i = n - 1$ means that there are two trailing digits which change).\n\nPlease notice that the answer may be very big and in case $c > 10^5$ you should print only the first $10^5$ moves. Your answer is considered correct if it is possible to finish your printed moves to win the jackpot in the minimal possible number of coins. In particular, if there are multiple ways to do this, you can output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n223\n322\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1\n2 -1\n\nInput\n2\n20\n42\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1\n1 1\n\nInput\n2\n35\n44\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we can make a +1 operation on the two first digits, transforming number $\\textbf{22}3$ into $\\textbf{33}3$, and then make a -1 operation on the last two digits, transforming $3\\textbf{33}$ into $3\\textbf{22}$.\n\nIt's also possible to do these operations in reverse order, which makes another correct answer.\n\nIn the last example, one can show that it's impossible to transform $35$ into $44$.\n\nAnswer:\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, (x for x in input())))\n    b = list(map(int, (x for x in input())))\n    x = [0] * (n - 1)\n    x[0] = b[0] - a[0]\n    for i in range(1, n - 1):\n        x[i] = b[i] - a[i] - x[i - 1]\n    if a[n - 1] + x[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    cnt = sum(map(abs, x))  # prevbug: ftl\n    print(cnt)\n    cnt = min(cnt, 10 ** 5)\n    index = 0\n\n    def handle_zero_nine(cur_zero):\n        nonlocal cnt\n        nxt = index + 1\n        # cur_zero = True prevbug: preserved this line\n        while True:\n            if cur_zero and a[nxt + 1] != 9:\n                break\n            if not cur_zero and a[nxt + 1] != 0:\n                break\n            nxt += 1\n            cur_zero = not cur_zero\n        while nxt > index:\n            if cnt == 0:\n                break\n            if cur_zero:\n                print(nxt + 1, 1)\n                a[nxt] += 1\n                a[nxt + 1] += 1\n            else:\n                print(nxt + 1, -1)\n                a[nxt] -= 1\n                a[nxt + 1] -= 1\n            nxt -= 1\n            cnt -= 1\n            # print(a)\n            cur_zero = not cur_zero\n\n    while cnt > 0:\n        if a[index] == b[index]:\n            index += 1\n            continue\n        elif a[index] > b[index] and a[index + 1] == 0:\n            handle_zero_nine(True)\n        elif a[index] < b[index] and a[index + 1] == 9:\n            handle_zero_nine(False)\n        elif a[index] > b[index]:\n            print(index + 1, -1)\n            a[index] -= 1\n            a[index + 1] -= 1\n            cnt -= 1\n            # print(a)\n        elif a[index] < b[index]:\n            print(index + 1, 1)\n            a[index] += 1\n            a[index + 1] += 1\n            cnt -= 1\n            # print(a)\n\n\ndef __starting_point():\n    main()\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nIn competitive weightlifting, you must perform a sequence of lifts.

Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard.

Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right.

At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed.  $8$ \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (r, c) the cell located at the row r and at the column c.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn.

It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n........\n........\n.B....B.\n....W...\n........\n..W.....\n........\n........\n\nOutput\nA\n\nInput\n..B.....\n..W.....\n......B.\n........\n.....W..\n......B.\n........\n........\n\nOutput\nB\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4, 5). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

He invited his N close friends. Let us number the people from 1 to N according to the order in which they arrive at the event. The dinner is being held in long straight corridor in which people sit in a way such that they won't leave any empty space in between two consecutive persons at any given time. \n\nWhen a person number i arrives at the corridor, he must go and stand to the immediate right of the person numbered A[i] (if A[i] = 0, then this person just stands at the leftmost end of the line). \n\nBut there is a problem, as there is no space between two consecutive persons at any given time, so for this person to sit, space must be created by moving either all the persons to left of the place to the left one step each, or all the persons to right of the place to the right one step each.  \n\nNow, Sereja is wondering about what could be the minimum number of steps people will take so as to sit in the dinner party. Please find it fast, so that Sereja can peacefully entertain his guests.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of input contain an integer T \u2014 the number of test cases.

The line after the arrangement of these persons will look like [1, 2, 3].  \n\n- When person #4 comes in, he wants to sit to the right of person 1, so we need to either move the first person to the left, or the second and third persons to the right. The first case is clearly better. Now the line will look like [1, 4, 2, 3].  \n\n- When person #5 arrives, he will need to move 2 persons in either case. The final arrangement will be [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]. \n\nSo total number of steps people moved during the entire process is 1 + 2 = 3.

This is the problem statement:\n\nTomorrow is Nadia's birthday, and Bardia (her brother) is assigned to make the balloons ready!\n\nThere are n balloons (initially empty) that are tied to a straight line on certain positions x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. Bardia inflates the balloons from left to right. As a result, i-th balloon gets bigger and bigger until its radius reaches the pressure endurance p_{i} or it touches another previously-inflated balloon. [Image] \n\nWhile Bardia was busy with the balloons, he wondered \"What will be the sum of radius of balloons after all of the balloons are inflated?\". Being a nerdy type of guy, he is now thinking about the problem instead of preparing his sister's birthday. Calculate the answer to Bardia's problem so that Nadia's birthday won't be balloon-less.\n\nArtha \u2014 Martha's student \u2014 claimed his solution got accepted. Martha (being his teacher for a long time!) knew he couldn't have solved the problem for real and thus thinks there is something wrong with the testcases. Artha isn't anyhow logical, which means there is no way for Martha to explain the wrong point in his algorithm. So, the only way is to find a testcase to prove him wrong!\n\nArtha's pseudo-code is shown below: [Image] \n\nYou should output a small testcase for the problem such that Artha's algorithm is incorrect. The algorithm's output is considered correct if it differs from the correct value by no more than 1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nPlease pay attention! No input will be given to your program for this problem. So you do not have to read from the input anything.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nYou should output the generated small testcase (which Artha's solution doesn't get it right). It should be in the following format:  First line must contain the only number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500).  The i-th of the next n lines should contain the description of the i-th balloon \u2014 two space-separated integers x_{i}, p_{i} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 10^6, 0 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{n} \u2264 10^6). \n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe testcase depicted in the figure above (just showing how output should be formatted):\n\n4\n\n0 9\n\n6 3\n\n12 7\n\n17 1\n\nAnswer:\nprint(302)\nprint(\"0 1000000\")\ncoord, rad = 17321*2, 300\nfor i in range(300):\n    print(coord, rad)\n    coord, rad = coord+600, rad-1\nprint(\"1000000 1000000\")\n\n\nQUESTION:\nHeidi got one brain, thumbs up! But the evening isn't over yet and one more challenge awaits our dauntless agent: after dinner, at precisely midnight, the N attendees love to play a very risky game...\n\nEvery zombie gets a number n_{i} (1 \u2264 n_{i} \u2264 N) written on his forehead. Although no zombie can see his own number, he can see the numbers written on the foreheads of all N - 1 fellows. Note that not all numbers have to be unique (they can even all be the same). From this point on, no more communication between zombies is allowed. Observation is the only key to success. When the cuckoo clock strikes midnight, all attendees have to simultaneously guess the number on their own forehead. If at least one of them guesses his number correctly, all zombies survive and go home happily. On the other hand, if not a single attendee manages to guess his number correctly, all of them are doomed to die!\n\nZombies aren't very bright creatures though, and Heidi has to act fast if she does not want to jeopardize her life. She has one single option: by performing some quick surgery on the brain she managed to get from the chest, she has the ability to remotely reprogram the decision-making strategy of all attendees for their upcoming midnight game! Can you suggest a sound strategy to Heidi which, given the rules of the game, ensures that at least one attendee will guess his own number correctly, for any possible sequence of numbers on the foreheads?\n\nGiven a zombie's rank R and the N - 1 numbers n_{i} on the other attendees' foreheads, your program will have to return the number that the zombie of rank R shall guess. Those answers define your strategy, and we will check if it is flawless or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 50000): the number of scenarios for which you have to make a guess.\n\nThe T scenarios follow, described on two lines each:   The first line holds two integers, N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 6), the number of attendees, and R (1 \u2264 R \u2264 N), the rank of the zombie who has to make the guess.

Then follow $N$ lines, each with 2 integers $c_ i$ and $t_ i$, denoting the amount of cash in Swedish crowns person $i$ has and the time in minutes from now after which person $i$ leaves if not served. Note that it takes one minute to serve a person and you must begin serving a person at time $t_ i$ at the latest. You can assume that $1\\le c_ i \\le 100000$ and $0 \\le t_ i < T$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the maximum amount of money you can get from the people in the queue before the bank closes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 4\n1000 1\n2000 2\n500 2\n1200 0\nSample Output:\n4200\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

You give an example reference string $s$ to the students.\nYou notice that your students just copy paste the reference string instead of creating their own string. So, you tweak the requirements for strings submitted by the students.\nLet us define a function F(s, t) where s and t are strings as the number of characters that are same in both the strings. Note that the position doesn't matter. Here are a few examples of F(s, t):\nF(\"abc\", \"def\") = 0\nF(\"abc\", \"acb\") = 3\nF(\"back\", \"abcd\") = 3\nNow you ask your students to output a string t with lowercase unique characters of the same length as $s$, such that F(s, t) $\\leq k$ where you are also given the value of $k$. If there are multiple such strings, you ask them to output the lexicographically smallest possible string. If no such string is possible, output the string \"NOPE\" without quotes.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, which contains a string $s$ and an integer $k$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the lexicographically smallest string t such that F(s, t) <= k or \"NOPE\" without quotes if no such string exists.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10000$\n- $1 \\leq $length of string s $(|s|) \\leq 26$\n- $s$ only consists of characters $a$ to $z$\n- There are no repeating characters in s\n- $0 \\leq k \\leq |s|$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4\nhelowrd 0\nbackground 0\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 0\nb 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nabcfgij\nefhijlmpqs\nNOPE\na\n\nAnswer:\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n s,k=map(str,input().split())\n k=int(k)\n n=\"NOPE\"\n al=[0]*26\n for ele in s:\n  al[ord(ele)-ord('a')]=1\n l=len(s)\n ans=[]\n # print(al)\n for i in range(26):\n  if len(ans)==l:\n   break\n  elif al[i]==1 and k>0:\n   k-=1\n   ans.append(chr(i+ord('a')))\n  elif al[i]==0:\n   ans.append(chr(i+ord('a')))\n \n if len(ans)!=l:\n  print(n)\n else:\n  print(\"\".join(ans))\n\nQUESTION:\nInsecure Inc.\u00a0has decided to shift directions after a failed attempt at developing a new encryption standard. Their new effort is a password system used to hide a password inside another string of characters we denote as a message. However, it is important that the message has a certain property relative to the hidden password.\n\nLet us assume that we denote the characters of the password as $ c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_ P$ (although those characters need not be distinct). To be a valid message for the password, if you start from the beginning of the message and search for any character from the set $\\{ c_1, \\ldots , c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_1$ is the first that you find. Subsequently, if you continue looking from that point of the message for any character from the set $\\{ c_2, \\ldots , c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_2$ is the next that you find. Continuing in that manner, $c_3$ must be the next character from the set $\\{ c_3, \\ldots , c_ P\\} $, and so on until reaching $c_ P$.\n\nFor example, if the password is ABC, then the string HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY is a valid message.\n - Notice that A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the message. (The initial H is not relevant.)\n - Following the A that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is B.\n - Following the B that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $C$\\} $ is indeed C.\n\n (Note that the A in DAY is not relevant, since we are only looking for a C at this point, and the additional A and C in CACEY are not relevant, because we have already completed the password with the first C.)\n\nHowever, for the password ABC, the string TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY is not a valid message.\n - While the A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the string,\n\n the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is C rather than B.\n\nAlso, the string HAPPYBIRTHDAY is not a valid message for the password ABC because the C never appears.\n\nAs an example with duplicate letters in the password, consider the password SECRET. For this password, the string SOMECHORESARETOUGH is a valid message. In contrast, the string SOMECHEERSARETOUGH is not a valid message, because an extraneous E is found at the point when an R is first expected.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two strings.

In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).\n\nFor any integer $k$ and positive integer $n$, let $k\\bmod n$ denote the remainder when $k$ is divided by $n$. More formally, $r=k\\bmod n$ is the smallest non-negative integer such that $k-r$ is divisible by $n$. It always holds that $0\\le k\\bmod n\\le n-1$. For example, $100\\bmod 12=4$ and $(-1337)\\bmod 3=1$.\n\nThen the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of $n$ integers $a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_{n-1}$. Then for each integer $k$, the guest in room $k$ is moved to room number $k+a_{k\\bmod n}$.\n\nAfter this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Next $2t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_{n-1}$ ($-10^9\\le a_i\\le 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" if there is exactly one guest assigned to each room after the shuffling process, or \"NO\" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n1\n14\n2\n1 -1\n4\n5 5 5 1\n3\n3 2 1\n2\n0 1\n5\n-239 -2 -100 -3 -11\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, every guest is shifted by $14$ rooms, so the assignment is still unique.\n\nIn the second test case, even guests move to the right by $1$ room, and odd guests move to the left by $1$ room. We can show that the assignment is still unique.\n\nIn the third test case, every fourth guest moves to the right by $1$ room, and the other guests move to the right by $5$ rooms. We can show that the assignment is still unique.\n\nIn the fourth test case, guests $0$ and $1$ are both assigned to room $3$.\n\nIn the fifth test case, guests $1$ and $2$ are both assigned to room $2$.\n\nAnswer:\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    l = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n    vals = [(x + i) % n for i, x in enumerate(l)]\n    print(\"YES\" if len(set(vals)) == n else \"NO\")\n\n\nQUESTION:\nAmugae has a hotel consisting of $10$ rooms. The rooms are numbered from $0$ to $9$ from left to right.\n\nThe hotel has two entrances \u2014 one from the left end, and another from the right end. When a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the left entrance. Similarly, when a customer arrives at the hotel through the right entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the right entrance.\n\nOne day, Amugae lost the room assignment list. Thankfully Amugae's memory is perfect, and he remembers all of the customers: when a customer arrived, from which entrance, and when they left the hotel. Initially the hotel was empty. Write a program that recovers the room assignment list from Amugae's memory.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), the number of events in Amugae's memory.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of length $n$ describing the events in chronological order.

[Image] \n\nAccording to choreography, the i-th dancer should stand still for the first t_{i} milliseconds, and then start moving in the specified direction at 1 unit per millisecond, until another border is reached. It is guaranteed that no two dancers have the same group, position and waiting time at the same time.\n\nWhen two dancers collide (i.e. are on the same point at some time when both of them are moving), they immediately exchange their moving directions and go on.

For example, (3, 2, 4, 1) is a permutation of length 4, but (3, 3, 1, 4) and (2, 3, 4, 5) are not, as (3, 3, 1, 4) contains duplicate elements, and (2, 3, 4, 5) contains elements not in range [1,4].\nA permutation p of length n is good if and only if for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, pi \u2260 i.\nPlease find the lexicographically smallest good permutation p.\nDefinition for \"lexicographically smaller\":\nFor two permutations p and q, we say that p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if there exists a index 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n such that:\n- For any 1 \u2264 i < l, pi = qi. Note that if l = 1, this constraint means nothing.\n- and, pl < ql.\n\nFor example, (2, 3, 1, 4) < (2, 3, 4, 1) < (3, 4, 1, 2). The lexicographically smallest permutation is, of course, (1, 2, ..., n), though this one is not good.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the only line contains an integer n.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest good permutation of length n.

The only good permutation of length 2 is (2, 1).\nExample case 2. Consider all permutations of length 3, they are(in lexicographically order):\n- p = (1, 2, 3), it's not good since p[1] = 1, p[2] = 2 and p[3] = 3;\n- p = (1, 3, 2), it's not good since p[1] = 1;\n- p = (2, 1, 3), it's not good since p[3] = 3;\n- p = (2, 3, 1), it's good since p[1] \u2260 1, p[2] \u2260 2 and p[3] \u2260 3;\n- p = (3, 1, 2), it's good since p[1] \u2260 1, p[2] \u2260 2 and p[3] \u2260 3;\n- p = (3, 2, 1), it's not good since p[2] = 2.\nThus the minimum good one is (2, 3, 1).\nExample case 3. Consider two good permutations for third test case: p=(2, 1, 4, 5, 3) and q=(2, 4, 1, 5, 3), then p < q. You can check lexicographically condition as follows. Find the first index where the entries of two permutations are different, and compare those entries. For example, in this case, the first position where the entries differ is index 2. You can see that p[2] < q[2], as 1 < 4, so p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n\nAnswer:\ntests = int(input())\r\nfor t in range(tests):\r\n  n = int(input())\r\n  permut='2'\r\n  permut_list=[]\r\n  if n%2==0:\r\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\r\n      if i%2==1:\r\n        permut=permut+' '+str(i+1)\r\n      else:\r\n        permut=permut+' '+str(i-1)\r\n    print(permut)\r\n    pass\r\n  elif n==1:\r\n    print(1)\r\n    pass\r\n  else:\r\n    for i in range(2, n):\r\n      if i%2==1:\r\n        permut_list.append(str(i+1))\r\n      else:\r\n        permut_list.append(str(i-1))\r\n    permut_list.pop(-1)\r\n    permut_list.append(str(n))\r\n    permut_list.append(str(n-2))\r\n    this_permut='2'\r\n    for el in permut_list:\r\n      this_permut=this_permut+' '+el\r\n    print(this_permut)\n\nQUESTION:\nA permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array.

Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or \"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.\n\nJeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff find the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game if he moves optimally well.\n\nYou can consider that the coin shows the heads (or tails) with the probability of 50 percent.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000).

It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\leq m \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq a < b \\leq 10^7$) \u2014 the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times. Each of the following lines contains three integers $u, v, c$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$, $u \\neq v$, $c \\in \\{a, b\\}$) denoting a single gravel road between the settlements $u$ and $v$, which requires $c$ minutes to travel.\n\nYou can assume that the road network is connected and has no loops or multiedges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line containing $n$ integers. The $p$-th of them should denote the minimum possible time required to travel from $1$ to $p$ after the selected roads are abandoned. Note that for each $p$ you can abandon a different set of roads.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5 20 25\n1 2 25\n2 3 25\n3 4 20\n4 5 20\n5 1 20\n\nOutput\n0 25 60 40 20\n\nInput\n6 7 13 22\n1 2 13\n2 3 13\n1 4 22\n3 4 13\n4 5 13\n5 6 13\n6 1 13\n\nOutput\n0 13 26 39 26 13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe minimum possible sum of times required to pass each road in the first example is $85$ \u2014 exactly one of the roads with passing time $25$ must be abandoned.

The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!\n\nThere are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it\u2019s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \\leq n,m \\leq 200000)$, the number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow $m$ lines containing three space-separated integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $t_ i$ each $(1 \\le a_ i, b_ i \\le n, 0 \\le t_ i \\le 10000)$, which, as explained above, represent the two cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls showing on the radar.

The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!\n\nThere are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it\u2019s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \\leq n,m \\leq 200000)$, the number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow $m$ lines containing three space-separated integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $t_ i$ each $(1 \\le a_ i, b_ i \\le n, 0 \\le t_ i \\le 10000)$, which, as explained above, represent the two cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls showing on the radar. Each ID $c$ satisfies the bound $1 \\leq c \\leq n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the Dragon Ball radar. If there is no way to complete this task, print $-1$ instead.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 9\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 1\n5 6 1\n6 7 1\n7 8 1\n8 9 1\n9 10 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nSample Output:\n6\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

You may consult the following example coding questions and their answers to provide the code. Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nTwo players are playing a game. The game is played on a sequence of positive integer pairs. The players make their moves alternatively. During his move the player chooses a pair and decreases the larger integer in the pair by a positive multiple of the smaller integer in the pair in such a way that both integers in the pair remain positive. If two numbers in some pair become equal then the pair is removed from the sequence. The player who can not make any move loses (or in another words the player who encounters an empty sequence loses). Given the sequence of positive integer pairs determine whether the first player can win or not (assuming that both players are playing optimally).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test starts with an integer N denoting the number of pairs. Each of the next N lines contains a pair of positive integers. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" if the first player can win and \"NO\" otherwise. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n- All other integers are between 1 to 108\n- The integers in each pair will be different\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n1\n2 3\n2\n4 5\n5 6\n2\n2 3\n3 5\n\nOutput:\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. The first player don't have any choice other subtracting 2 from 3. So during the turn of the second player integer pair will be (2,1). The second player will win by subtracting 1 from 2. \nExample case 2. If the first player choose to move (4,5) to (4,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). If the first player choose to move (5,6) to (5,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). So regardless of the move of the first player, the second will always win.\nExample case 3. The first player will select pair (3,5) and make it to (3,2). Now both pairs are equal. So whatever the move of second player he will just mirror that move in another pair. This will ensure his win.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\n\nt = int(input())\n\ndef g(a,b):\n if (a > b):\n  tmp = a\n  a = b\n  b = tmp\n if (b == a):\n  return 0\n if (b % a == 0):\n  return int(b\/a)-1\n r = g(b%a,a)\n q = int(b\/a)\n if (r >= q):\n  return q-1\n else:\n  return q\n\ndef mex(x):\n n = len(list(x.keys()))\n for i in range(n):\n  if (i not in x):\n   return i\n return i\n\ndef g2(a,b):\n if (a == b):\n  return 0\n if (a > b):\n  tmp = a\n  a = b\n  b = tmp\n if (b % a == 0):\n  return int(b\/a)-1\n q = int(b\/a)\n x = {}\n r = b % a\n for i in range(q):\n  x[g2(r+i*a,a)] = True\n return mex(x)\n\n#print(str(g(6,33))+\" \"+str(g2(6,33)))\n\nwhile (t):\n\n n = int(input())\n x = 0\n while (n):\n  line = input().split()\n  a = int(line[0])\n  b = int(line[1])\n  x ^= g(a,b)\n  n -= 1\n if (x):\n  sys.stdout.write(\"YES\\n\")\n else:\n  sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n #print(str(g(a,b)) + \" \" + str(g2(a,b)))\n t -= 1\n\nQUESTION:\nThere are five people playing a game called \"Generosity\".

The term originated with the Harvard Mark I computer, delivered by IBM in 1944, which used paper tape for instructions and relays for data. \n\nSome modern microcontrollers use the Harvard architecture \u2013 but not paper tape and relays! Data memory is organized in banks, each containing the same number of data items. Each data-referencing instruction has a byte offset $f$ to a bank, and a bit $a$ that is used to select the bank to be referenced. If $a$ is $0$, then bank $0$ is referenced. If $a$ is $1$, then the value in a bank select register (BSR) identifies the bank to be used. Assume each instruction takes the same time to execute, and there is an instruction that can set the BSR\u2019s value.\n\nFor example, suppose there are $4$ banks of $8$ bytes each. To access location $5$, either use a single instruction with $a = 0$ and $f = 5$, or set the BSR to $0$ in one instruction and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 5$. The first approach is faster since it does not require setting the BSR.\n\nNow suppose (with the same memory) the location to access is $20$. Only one approach will work here: execute an instruction that sets the BSR to $2$ (unless the BSR already has the value $2$) and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 4$.\n\nA program is a sequence of operations. Each operation is either\n - a variable reference, written as V$i$, where $i$ is a positive integer, or\n - a repetition, written as R$n$ <program> E, where $n$ is a positive integer and <program> is an arbitrary program. This operation is equivalent to $n$ sequential occurrences of <program>.\n\nYour problem is to determine the minimum running time of programs. In particular, given the number and size of the memory banks and a program to be executed, find the minimum number of instructions (which reference memory location and possibly set the BSR) that must be executed to run the program. To do this you must identify a mapping of variables to memory banks that yields the smallest execution time, and report that execution time \u2013 that is, the number of memory references and BSR register settings required. The BSR\u2019s value is initially undefined, and changes only when an instruction explicitly sets its value.\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case.

Similarly, each closing parentheses has a preceding opening parentheses matching it. For each pair of matching parentheses there are no other parenthesis between them.

Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of wine is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible.\n\nHowever, the King has 10 lab rats. He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of wine contains the poison. The poison when taken has no effect on the rats, until exactly 24 hours later when the infected rats suddenly die. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow, so that the festivities can continue as planned.\n\nHence he only has time for one round of testing, he decides that each rat tastes multiple bottles, according to a certain scheme.\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nYou receive an array of integers (`0 to 9`), each of them is the number of a rat which died after tasting the wine bottles.

Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number i (i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is p_{i}-th inflorescence and p_{i} < i.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to p_{a}-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.\n\nHelp Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains single integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u00a0\u2014 number of inflorescences.\n\nSecond line of input contains sequence of n - 1 integer numbers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} < i), where p_{i} is number of inflorescence into which the apple from i-th inflorescence rolls down.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nSingle line of output should contain one integer number: amount of apples that Arcady will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5\n1 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n18\n1 1 1 4 4 3 2 2 2 10 8 9 9 9 10 10 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example Arcady will be able to collect only one apple, initially situated in 1st inflorescence.

You may choose an arbitrary permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_N$ of the integers $1$ through $N$. Then, for each vertex $i$, you should assign the value $A_{p_i}$ to this vertex.\nThe profit of a path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is the sum of the values assigned to the vertices on that path (including $u$ and $v$).\nLet's consider only (undirected) paths that start at a leaf and end at a different leaf. Calculate the maximum possible value of the sum of profits of all such paths. Since this value could be very large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n- Each of the following $N\u22121$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum sum of profits, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 300,000$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n-----Example Output-----\n24\n15\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: $(1, 4, 2, 3)$ is one of the possible permutations that give the optimal answer.

He likes order and balance, so he decided to reorder the numbers.\n\nThere are $k$ boxes numbered from $1$ to $k$. The $i$-th box contains $n_i$ integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. \n\nUjan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, $k$ integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers\u00a0\u2014 one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning. Note that he may also insert an integer he picked from a box back into the same box.\n\nUjan will be happy if the sum of the integers in each box is the same. Can he achieve this and make the boxes perfectly balanced, like all things should be?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 15$), the number of boxes. \n\nThe $i$-th of the next $k$ lines first contains a single integer $n_i$ ($1 \\leq n_i \\leq 5\\,000$), the number of integers in box $i$. Then the same line contains $n_i$ integers $a_{i,1}, \\ldots, a_{i,n_i}$ ($|a_{i,j}| \\leq 10^9$), the integers in the $i$-th box. \n\nIt is guaranteed that all $a_{i,j}$ are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Ujan cannot achieve his goal, output \"No\" in a single line. Otherwise in the first line output \"Yes\", and then output $k$ lines. The $i$-th of these lines should contain two integers $c_i$ and $p_i$. This means that Ujan should pick the integer $c_i$ from the $i$-th box and place it in the $p_i$-th box afterwards.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of those.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n3 1 7 4\n2 3 2\n2 8 5\n1 10\n\nOutput\nYes\n7 2\n2 3\n5 1\n10 4\n\nInput\n2\n2 3 -2\n2 -1 5\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n2\n2 -10 10\n2 0 -20\n\nOutput\nYes\n-10 2\n-20 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Ujan can put the number $7$ in the $2$nd box, the number $2$ in the $3$rd box, the number $5$ in the $1$st box and keep the number $10$ in the same $4$th box. Then the boxes will contain numbers $\\{1,5,4\\}$, $\\{3, 7\\}$, $\\{8,2\\}$ and $\\{10\\}$. The sum in each box then is equal to $10$.\n\nIn the second sample, it is not possible to pick and redistribute the numbers in the required way.\n\nIn the third sample, one can swap the numbers $-20$ and $-10$, making the sum in each box equal to $-10$.\n\nAnswer:\n\ndef main():\n    k = int(input())\n    n = []\n    a = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        line = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n        ni = line[0]\n        ai = []\n        n.append(ni)\n        a.append(ai)\n        for j in range(ni):\n            ai.append(line[1 + j])\n    answer, c, p = solve(k, n, a)\n    if answer:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        for i in range(k):\n            print(c[i], p[i] + 1)\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\n\ndef solve(k, n, a):\n    asum, sums = calc_sums(k, n, a)\n    if asum % k != 0:\n        return False, None, None\n    tsum = asum \/ k\n    num_map = build_num_map(k, n, a)\n    masks = [None]*(1 << k)\n    simple = [False]*(1 << k)\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(n[i]):\n            found, mask, path = find_cycle(i, j, i, j, k, n, a, sums, tsum, num_map, 0, dict())\n            if found:\n                simple[mask] = True\n                masks[mask] = path\n    for i in range(1 << k):\n        if not simple[i]:\n            continue\n        mask = i\n        zeroes_count = 0\n        for u in range(k):\n            if (1 << u) > mask:\n                break\n            if (mask & (1 << u)) == 0:\n                zeroes_count += 1\n        for mask_mask in range(1 << zeroes_count):\n            mask_child = 0\n            c = 0\n            for u in range(k):\n                if (1 << u) > mask:\n                    break\n                if (mask & (1 << u)) == 0:\n                    if (mask_mask & (1 << c)) != 0:\n                        mask_child = mask_child | (1 << u)\n                    c += 1\n            if masks[mask_child] and not masks[mask_child | mask]:\n                masks[mask_child | mask] = {**masks[mask_child], **masks[mask]}\n                if (mask_child | mask) == ((1 << k) - 1):\n                    c = [-1] * k\n                    p = [-1] * k\n                    d = masks[(1 << k) - 1]\n                    for key, val in list(d.items()):\n                        c[key] = val[0]\n                        p[key] = val[1]\n                    return True, c, p\n    if masks[(1 << k) - 1]:\n        c = [-1] * k\n        p = [-1] * k\n        d = masks[(1 << k) - 1]\n        for key, val in list(d.items()):\n            c[key] = val[0]\n            p[key] = val[1]\n        return True, c, p\n    return False, None, None\n\n\ndef build_num_map(k, n, a):\n    result = dict()\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(n[i]):\n            result[a[i][j]] = (i, j)\n    return result\n\n\ndef find_cycle(i_origin, j_origin, i, j, k, n, a, sums, tsum, num_map, mask, path):\n    if (mask & (1 << i)) != 0:\n        if i == i_origin and j == j_origin:\n            return True, mask, path\n        else:\n            return False, None, None\n    mask = mask | (1 << i)\n    a_needed = tsum - (sums[i] - a[i][j])\n    if a_needed not in num_map:\n        return False, None, None\n    i_next, j_next = num_map[a_needed]\n    path[i_next] = (a[i_next][j_next], i)\n    return find_cycle(i_origin, j_origin, i_next, j_next, k, n, a, sums, tsum, num_map, mask, path)\n\n\ndef calc_sums(k, n, a):\n    sums = [0] * k\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(n[i]):\n            sums[i] = sums[i] + a[i][j]\n    asum = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        asum = asum + sums[i]\n    return asum, sums\n\n\ndef __starting_point():\n    main()\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon arrived at the entrance of Udayland.

If the corresponding cell is empty, a_{i}, j will be equal to 0. Otherwise, a_{i}, j is positive.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is exactly one pair of integers i, j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n) such that a_{i}, j = 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer, the positive integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18) that should be filled in the empty cell so that the whole grid becomes a magic square. If such positive integer x does not exist, output  - 1 instead.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n4 0 2\n3 5 7\n8 1 6\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, we can fill in 9 into the empty cell to make the resulting grid a magic square. Indeed, \n\nThe sum of numbers in each row is:\n\n4 + 9 + 2 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.\n\nThe sum of numbers in each column is:\n\n4 + 3 + 8 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.\n\nThe sum of numbers in the two diagonals is:\n\n4 + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15.\n\nIn the third sample case, it is impossible to fill a number in the empty square such that the resulting grid is a magic square.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 3 3 4\n\nOutput\n1\n2 3 4 4 \n\nInput\n5\n3 2 2 5 3\n\nOutput\n0\n3 2 2 5 3 \n\nInput\n8\n2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7\n\nOutput\n2\n2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p_4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.

The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, the root is the vertex number 1.\n\nEach vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex v by c_{v}.

Append at most $3$ elements to it to make it good. Appended elements don't have to be different. It can be shown that the solution always exists under the given constraints. If there are different solutions, you are allowed to output any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of added elements!.

Yes he does! Almost all of the dishes in his restaurant is named by a palindrome strings. The problem is that a name of a dish should not be too long, so The Chef has only limited choices when naming a new dish.\n\nFor the given positive integer N, your task is to calculate the number of palindrome strings of length not exceeding N, that contain only lowercase letters of English alphabet (letters from 'a' to 'z', inclusive).

His guests are hungry, so he instructs his cow Bessie to bring out the snacks! Moo!\n\nThere are $n$ snacks flavors, numbered with integers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Bessie has $n$ snacks, one snack of each flavor. Every guest has exactly two favorite flavors. The procedure for eating snacks will go as follows:  First, Bessie will line up the guests in some way.  Then in this order, guests will approach the snacks one by one.  Each guest in their turn will eat all remaining snacks of their favorite flavor. In case no favorite flavors are present when a guest goes up, they become very sad.  \n\nHelp Bessie to minimize the number of sad guests by lining the guests in an optimal way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le k \\le 10^5$), the number of snacks and the number of guests. \n\nThe $i$-th of the following $k$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$, $x_i \\ne y_i$), favorite snack flavors of the $i$-th guest.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer, the smallest possible number of sad guests.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 4\n1 2\n4 3\n1 4\n3 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n6 5\n2 3\n2 1\n3 4\n6 5\n4 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Bessie can order the guests like this: $3, 1, 2, 4$. Guest $3$ goes first and eats snacks $1$ and $4$. Then the guest $1$ goes and eats the snack $2$ only, because the snack $1$ has already been eaten. Similarly, the guest $2$ goes up and eats the snack $3$ only. All the snacks are gone, so the guest $4$ will be sad. \n\nIn the second example, one optimal ordering is $2, 1, 3, 5, 4$.

Don\u2019t worry, this is a regular thing in Croatia. The best part was the abundance of food! There was everything, starting from good spicy sausages, ham, black pudding, up to teewurst, top quality bacon and \u010dvarci, all with warm white bread and butter. After these appetizers, it was the perfect time to whip up a deep pot full of sarma (Melita ate twentyish of them) as well as a large platter of fine roast pork, so soft that it almost melts in your mouth. They watered all of this down with copious gulps of the best dry white wine that made them even hungrier.\n\nButcher Bajs kept his award-winning ham for the very end. $N$ people attented the annual pig slaughter, labeled with numbers from 1 to $N$. These people already ate a lot of meat: the $k$-th person ate $A[k]$ kilograms of meat so far.

Don\u2019t worry, this is a regular thing in Croatia. The best part was the abundance of food! There was everything, starting from good spicy sausages, ham, black pudding, up to teewurst, top quality bacon and \u010dvarci, all with warm white bread and butter. After these appetizers, it was the perfect time to whip up a deep pot full of sarma (Melita ate twentyish of them) as well as a large platter of fine roast pork, so soft that it almost melts in your mouth. They watered all of this down with copious gulps of the best dry white wine that made them even hungrier.\n\nButcher Bajs kept his award-winning ham for the very end. $N$ people attented the annual pig slaughter, labeled with numbers from 1 to $N$.

He has a checkered field of size n \u00d7 n cells, where m various cells are banned. Before the game, he has to put a few chips on some border (but not corner) board cells. Then for n - 1 minutes, Gerald every minute moves each chip into an adjacent cell. He moves each chip from its original edge to the opposite edge. Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases:  At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell.  At least once two chips were on the same cell.  At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). \n\nIn that case he loses and earns 0 points. When nothing like that happened, he wins and earns the number of points equal to the number of chips he managed to put on the board. Help Gerald earn the most points.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the field and the number of banned cells.

Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases:  At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell.  At least once two chips were on the same cell.  At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). \n\nIn that case he loses and earns 0 points.

In this version, all numbers in the given array are distinct and the constraints on $n$ are less than in the hard version of the problem.\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers (there are no equals elements in the array). You can perform the following operations on array elements:  choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and move the element $a[i]$ to the begin of the array;  choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and move the element $a[i]$ to the end of the array. \n\nFor example, if $n = 5$, $a = [4, 7, 2, 3, 9]$, then the following sequence of operations can be performed:   after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array $a$ will become $[7, 4, 2, 3, 9]$;  after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array $a$ will become $[7, 2, 3, 9, 4]$. \n\nYou can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.\n\nFind the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the $a$ array sorted in non-decreasing order. In other words, what is the minimum number of operations that must be performed so the array satisfies the inequalities $a[1] \\le a[2] \\le \\ldots \\le a[n]$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.

In each step, Duff can lift some of the remaining weights and throw them away. She does this until there's no more weight left. Malek asked her to minimize the number of steps. [Image] \n\nDuff is a competitive programming fan.

On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.\n\nAnswer:\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    a, b, c, d = (list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in 'abcd')\n    ss, tt, n2, res = [*b, *c[::-1]], [*a, *d[::-1]], n * 2, []\n    yx = [*[(2, i + 1) for i in range(n)], *[(3, i) for i in range(n, 0, -1)]]\n\n    def park():\n        for i, s, t, (y, x) in zip(range(n2), ss, tt, yx):\n            if s == t != 0:\n                ss[i] = 0\n                res.append(f'{s} {(1, 4)[y == 3]} {x}')\n\n    def rotate():\n        start = ss.index(0)\n        for i in range(start - n2, start - 1):\n            s = ss[i] = ss[i + 1]\n            if s:\n                y, x = yx[i]\n                res.append(f'{s} {y} {x}')\n        ss[start - 1] = 0\n\n    park()\n    if all(ss):\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    while any(ss):\n        rotate()\n        park()\n    print(len(res), '\\n'.join(res), sep='\\n')\n\n\ndef __starting_point():\n    main()\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nRichard and Janet are going on their first date. Richard has offered to meet her at home with his bicycle, and Janet tells him she will call when she is ready in $10$ to $20$ minutes. But Richard is an impatient person; while he could wait at home for Janet\u2019s signal, he might also leave early and travel around the neighbourhood for a bit, in order to minimise the time it takes him to reach her once she calls. Due to his impatience, once Richard is on his bicycle, he does not want to ride any slower than the legal speed limit, stop at intersections, or wait outside Janet\u2019s house (but he does not mind passing by Janet\u2019s house and returning to it later).\n\nGiven the directed graph representing the neighbourhood around Richard\u2019s and Janet\u2019s houses, Richard wants to devise a route around the neighbourhood (after an optional waiting period at his own house) which minimises the time that Janet has to wait in the worst case. He can travel for as long as he likes and visit each intersection as many times as he likes.\n\nJanet will call Richard as soon as she is ready, and at that point Richard will take the shortest path to her that he can. Richard does not know exactly when Janet will be ready, but he knows it will be in somewhere between $a$ and $b$ minutes (not necessarily at a whole minute).\n\nIf Richard is passing through an intersection at the exact same instant Janet calls, the call is considered to happen before he chooses what to do at the intersection. For example, if he is passing by Janet\u2019s house at the moment she calls, he can immediately stop there and she does not have to wait for him at all.\n\nIt could happen that Janet never has to wait for $w$ minutes, but that she might have to wait for $w - \\epsilon $ minutes for arbitrarily small $\\epsilon > 0$, if she calls Richard at some inopportune moment (say, nanoseconds after he has left an intersection).

Initially, each cell of this grid is either empty, contains an ant or an anteater. Each ant is moving in a fixed direction: up, down, left or right. The anteaters do not move.\nThe movement of ants happens in discrete steps. For example, when an ant is in the cell in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column at some point in time (in some step) and it is moving down, then in the next step, it enters the cell in the $(i+1)$-th row and $j$-th column. Two ants meet each other when they enter the same cell at the same point in time (in the same step). When ants meet, they do not interact in any way and keep moving in their fixed directions.\nIf an ant reaches an anteater, that anteater eats the ant, so the ant completely disappears. If an ant attempts to leave the grid, it also disappears. When two ants enter a cell containing an anteater at the same time, they are eaten before they could meet.\nCalculate the total number of pairs of ants that meet each other.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.\n\nIn the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.\n\nPetya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of lines.\n\nNext n lines contain commands. A command consists of a character that represents the operation (\"&\", \"|\" or \"^\" for AND, OR or XOR respectively), and the constant x_{i} 0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 1023.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 5) \u2014 the length of your program.\n\nNext k lines must contain commands in the same format as in the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n| 3\n^ 2\n| 1\n\nOutput\n2\n| 3\n^ 2\n\nInput\n3\n& 1\n& 3\n& 5\n\nOutput\n1\n& 1\n\nInput\n3\n^ 1\n^ 2\n^ 3\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nYou can read about bitwise operations in https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bitwise_operation.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nLet x be an input of the Petya's program. It's output is ((x&1)&3)&5 = x&(1&3&5) = x&1. So these two programs always give the same outputs.\n\nAnswer:\nfrom operator import __or__, __and__, __xor__\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\nn, b, c = int(stdin.readline()), 0, 1023\nm = {'|': __or__, '&': __and__, '^': __xor__}\nfor i in range(n):\n    t, v = [i for i in stdin.readline().split()]\n    b = m[t](b, int(v))\n    c = m[t](c, int(v))\nx, o, a = 0, 0, 1023\nfor i in range(10):\n    if ((b >> i) & 1) and ((c >> i) & 1):\n        o |= 1 << i\n    elif not ((b >> i) & 1) and not ((c >> i) & 1):\n        a -= 1 << i\n    elif ((b >> i) & 1) and not ((c >> i) & 1):\n        x |= 1 << i\nstdout.write('3\\n| ' + str(o) + '\\n^ ' + str(x) + '\\n& ' + str(a))\n        \n\n\nQUESTION:\nThe classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++.

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nSereja loves all sorts of algorithms. He has recently come up with a new algorithm, which receives a string as an input. Let's represent the input string of the algorithm as q = q_1q_2... q_{k}. The algorithm consists of two steps:\n\n  Find any continuous subsequence (substring) of three characters of string q, which doesn't equal to either string \"zyx\", \"xzy\", \"yxz\". If q doesn't contain any such subsequence, terminate the algorithm, otherwise go to step 2.  Rearrange the letters of the found subsequence randomly and go to step 1. \n\nSereja thinks that the algorithm works correctly on string q if there is a non-zero probability that the algorithm will be terminated. But if the algorithm anyway will work for infinitely long on a string, then we consider the algorithm to work incorrectly on this string.\n\nSereja wants to test his algorithm. For that, he has string s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, consisting of n characters. The boy conducts a series of m tests. As the i-th test, he sends substring s_{l}_{i}s_{l}_{i} + 1... s_{r}_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n) to the algorithm input. Unfortunately, the implementation of his algorithm works too long, so Sereja asked you to help. For each test (l_{i}, r_{i}) determine if the algorithm works correctly on this test or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains non-empty string s, its length (n) doesn't exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed that string s only contains characters: 'x', 'y', 'z'.\n\nThe second line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of tests. Next m lines contain the tests. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test, print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the algorithm works correctly on the corresponding test and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nzyxxxxxxyyz\n5\n5 5\n1 3\n1 11\n1 4\n3 6\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, in test one and two the algorithm will always be terminated in one step. In the fourth test you can get string \"xzyx\" on which the algorithm will terminate.

For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not. Each bracket in CBS has a pair. For example, in \"(()(()))\":  1st bracket is paired with 8th,  2d bracket is paired with 3d,  3d bracket is paired with 2d,  4th bracket is paired with 7th,  5th bracket is paired with 6th,  6th bracket is paired with 5th,  7th bracket is paired with 4th,  8th bracket is paired with 1st. \n\nPolycarp's editor currently supports only three operations during the use of CBS. The cursor in the editor takes the whole position of one of the brackets (not the position between the brackets!). There are three operations being supported:  \u00abL\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the left,  \u00abR\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the right,  \u00abD\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 delete the bracket in which the cursor is located, delete the bracket it's paired to and all brackets between them (that is, delete a substring between the bracket in which the cursor is located and the one it's paired to). \n\nAfter the operation \"D\" the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the right (of course, among the non-deleted). If there is no such bracket (that is, the suffix of the CBS was deleted), then the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the left (of course, among the non-deleted). \n\nThere are pictures illustrated several usages of operation \"D\" below. [Image] \n\nAll incorrect operations (shift cursor over the end of CBS, delete the whole CBS, etc.) are not supported by Polycarp's editor.\n\nPolycarp is very proud of his development, can you implement the functionality of his editor?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three positive integers n, m and p (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 500 000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of brackets in the correct bracket sequence, the number of operations and the initial position of cursor. Positions in the sequence are numbered from left to right, starting from one. It is guaranteed that n is even.\n\nIt is followed by the string of n characters \"(\" and \")\" forming the correct bracket sequence.\n\nThen follow a string of m characters \"L\", \"R\" and \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 a sequence of the operations. Operations are carried out one by one from the first to the last. It is guaranteed that the given operations never move the cursor outside the bracket sequence, as well as the fact that after all operations a bracket sequence will be non-empty.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the correct bracket sequence, obtained as a result of applying all operations to the initial sequence.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 4 5\n(())()()\nRDLD\n\nOutput\n()\n\nInput\n12 5 3\n((()())(()))\nRRDLD\n\nOutput\n(()(()))\n\nInput\n8 8 8\n(())()()\nLLLLLLDD\n\nOutput\n()()\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the cursor is initially at position 5. Consider actions of the editor:  command \"R\"\u00a0\u2014 the cursor moves to the position 6 on the right;  command \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 the deletion of brackets from the position 5 to the position 6.

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\nQUESTION:\nRecently Polycarp started to develop a text editor that works only with correct bracket sequences (abbreviated as CBS). \n\nNote that a bracket sequence is correct if it is possible to get a correct mathematical expression by adding \"+\"-s and \"1\"-s to it. For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not. Each bracket in CBS has a pair. For example, in \"(()(()))\":  1st bracket is paired with 8th,  2d bracket is paired with 3d,  3d bracket is paired with 2d,  4th bracket is paired with 7th,  5th bracket is paired with 6th,  6th bracket is paired with 5th,  7th bracket is paired with 4th,  8th bracket is paired with 1st. \n\nPolycarp's editor currently supports only three operations during the use of CBS. The cursor in the editor takes the whole position of one of the brackets (not the position between the brackets!). There are three operations being supported:  \u00abL\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the left,  \u00abR\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the right,  \u00abD\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 delete the bracket in which the cursor is located, delete the bracket it's paired to and all brackets between them (that is, delete a substring between the bracket in which the cursor is located and the one it's paired to). \n\nAfter the operation \"D\" the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the right (of course, among the non-deleted). If there is no such bracket (that is, the suffix of the CBS was deleted), then the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the left (of course, among the non-deleted). \n\nThere are pictures illustrated several usages of operation \"D\" below. [Image] \n\nAll incorrect operations (shift cursor over the end of CBS, delete the whole CBS, etc.) are not supported by Polycarp's editor.\n\nPolycarp is very proud of his development, can you implement the functionality of his editor?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three positive integers n, m and p (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 500 000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of brackets in the correct bracket sequence, the number of operations and the initial position of cursor. Positions in the sequence are numbered from left to right, starting from one. It is guaranteed that n is even.\n\nIt is followed by the string of n characters \"(\" and \")\" forming the correct bracket sequence.\n\nThen follow a string of m characters \"L\", \"R\" and \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 a sequence of the operations. Operations are carried out one by one from the first to the last. It is guaranteed that the given operations never move the cursor outside the bracket sequence, as well as the fact that after all operations a bracket sequence will be non-empty.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the correct bracket sequence, obtained as a result of applying all operations to the initial sequence.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 4 5\n(())()()\nRDLD\n\nOutput\n()\n\nInput\n12 5 3\n((()())(()))\nRRDLD\n\nOutput\n(()(()))\n\nInput\n8 8 8\n(())()()\nLLLLLLDD\n\nOutput\n()()\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the cursor is initially at position 5. Consider actions of the editor:  command \"R\"\u00a0\u2014 the cursor moves to the position 6 on the right;  command \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 the deletion of brackets from the position 5 to the position 6. After that CBS takes the form (())(), the cursor is at the position 5;  command \"L\"\u00a0\u2014 the cursor moves to the position 4 on the left;  command \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 the deletion of brackets from the position 1 to the position 4.

Now it's time to clean up and Misha needs to put them in a basket. He ordered this task to his pet robot that agreed to complete the task at certain conditions. Before the robot puts a number x to the basket, Misha should answer the question: is it possible to choose one or multiple numbers that already are in the basket, such that their XOR sum equals x? \n\nIf the answer is positive, you also need to give the indexes of these numbers. If there are multiple options of choosing numbers, you are allowed to choose any correct option. After Misha's answer the robot puts the number to the basket.\n\nInitially the basket is empty. Each integer you put in the basket takes some number. The first integer you put into the basket take number 0, the second integer takes number 1 and so on.\n\nMisha needs to clean up the place as soon as possible but unfortunately, he isn't that good at mathematics. He asks you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains number m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000), showing how many numbers are scattered around the room.\n\nThe next m lines contain the numbers in the order in which the robot puts them in the basket. Each number is a positive integer strictly less than 10^600 that doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each number either print a 0 on the corresponding line, if the number cannot be represented as a XOR sum of numbers that are in the basket, or print integer k showing how many numbers are in the representation and the indexes of these numbers. Separate the numbers by spaces. Each number can occur in the representation at most once.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n0\n0\n3 0 1 2\n2 1 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 1\n\nInput\n2\n5\n5\n\nOutput\n0\n1 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe XOR sum of numbers is the result of bitwise sum of numbers modulo 2.\n\nAnswer:\nbuck = [[0, 0] for i in range(2201)]\nm = int(input())\nfor i in range(m):\n    a = int(input())\n    ok = True\n    br = 0\n    for j in range(2200, -1, -1):\n        if a & (1 << j):\n            if(buck[j][0]):\n                a  ^= buck[j][0]\n                br ^= buck[j][1]\n            else:\n                ok = False\n                buck[j][0] = a\n                buck[j][1] = br | (1 << i)\n                break\n    if not ok:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        lst = []\n        for j in range(2201):\n            if br & (1 << j):\n                lst.append(j)\n        print(len(lst), end = ' ')\n        for j in lst:\n            print(j, end = ' ')\n        print('\\n', end='')\n\n\nQUESTION:\nMirko got an array of integers for his birthday from his grandmother Norma.

The sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and their Potions class teacher, professor Snipe is sulky as usual. Due to his angst fueled by disappointment in his own life, he has given them a lot of homework in Potions class. \n\nEach of the n students has been assigned a single task. Some students do certain tasks faster than others. Thus, they want to redistribute the tasks so that each student still does exactly one task, and that all tasks are finished. Each student has their own laziness level, and each task has its own difficulty level. Professor Snipe is trying hard to improve their work ethics, so each student\u2019s laziness level is equal to their task\u2019s difficulty level. Both sets of values are given by the sequence a, where a_{i} represents both the laziness level of the i-th student and the difficulty of his task. \n\nThe time a student needs to finish a task is equal to the product of their laziness level and the task\u2019s difficulty.

Some weeks ago, they greatly impressed the other animals by forming a large tower. However, the frog king wants to surpass this performance at the next Benelux Amphibian Pillaring Ceremony (BAPC). He wants the frogs to perform a difficult dance which will end in a climax where all frogs form a tower. You have been appointed choreographer and will practice with the frogs in the following months.\n\nA frog dance is a form of line dance: a certain number of frogs line up and then perform a sequence of jumps, where every jump is either to the left or the right. The frog king decided to make this particular dance more interesting. Firstly, he dictated that the frogs have to increase the length of each jump. This means that for any frog, its first jump will be of length $1$, the second of length $2$, the third of length $3$, and so on. Secondly, the dance should end with all frogs on one big tower. Thirdly, the total number of jumps that the frogs make should be as low as possible, in order to make the dance flashy and impressive-looking.\n\nSince the king is a perfectionist, he wants the dance to be flawless. He has provided you with a team of excellent frog dancers, their starting positions, and the place he wants the frogs to form a tower at the end of the dance. However, the king still isn\u2019t convinced that the dance will be as perfect as he wants it to be, so he visits the rehearsal every day in order to make a change: he might find another frog that is very good at dancing and add it to the line-up, or he might feel that a frog is not good enough and remove him\/her. He can even change the position of the final tower if he feels like it.\n\nAt the end of every day, the frog king wants to see the dance performed in the most efficient way possible, i.e. with the lowest total number of jumps.\n\n-----Input-----\n - A single line containing two integers $0 \\leq n \\leq 5000$ and $0\\leq t\\leq 10^6$, the initial number of frogs and the initial position of the frog tower.\n - The second line contains $n$ integers $0\\leq p_ i\\leq 10^6$, the starting positions of these frogs.\n - Then follows a line with an integer $0\\leq C\\leq 10^6$, the number of changes the king makes.\n - $C$ lines follow, each of one of the following three forms.\n - A line of the form $+$ $a$ indicates that the king adds a frog at position $a$.\n - A line of the form $-$ $a$ indicates that the king removes a frog from position $a$.

During one move, you can do one of the following two operations:  Choose exactly one $i$ from $1$ to $n$ and increase $a_i$ by $x$ ($a_i := a_i + x$), then increase $x$ by $1$ ($x := x + 1$).  Just increase $x$ by $1$ ($x := x + 1$). \n\nThe first operation can be applied no more than once to each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain such an array that each its element is divisible by $k$ (the value $k$ is given).\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$\u00a0\u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i\/s$ minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i\/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i\/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \\cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $tc$ ($1 \\le tc \\le 20$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then $tc$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems in the contest.\n\nThe second line of the test contains two real values $C, T$ ($0 < C < 10$, $0 \\le T \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $C$ defines the efficiency of the training and $T$ is the duration of the contest in minutes. Value $C, T$ are given exactly with three digits after the decimal point.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines of the test contain characteristics of the corresponding problem: two integers $a_i, p_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$, $1 \\le p_i \\le 10$)\u00a0\u2014 the difficulty and the score of the problem.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the value of $T$ is such that changing it by the $0.001$ in any direction will not change the test answer.\n\nPlease note that in hacks you can only use $tc = 1$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $tc$ integers\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible score in each test case.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n4\n1.000 31.000\n12 3\n20 6\n30 1\n5 1\n3\n1.000 30.000\n1 10\n10 10\n20 8\n\nOutput\n7\n20\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Polycarp can get score of $7$ as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $4$-th problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves the problem in $5\/s=5\/4.5$, which is roughly $1.111$ minutes;  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $20\/s=20\/4.05$, which is roughly $4.938$ minutes. \n\nThis way, Polycarp uses roughly $4+10+1.111+10+4.938=30.049$ minutes, to get score of $7$ points. It is not possible to achieve larger score in $31$ minutes.\n\nIn the second example, Polycarp can get $20$ points as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $1$-st problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves problem in $1\/s=1\/4.5$, which is roughly $0.222$ minutes.  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $10\/s=10\/4.05$, which is roughly $2.469$ minutes. \n\nThis way, Polycarp gets score of $20$ in $4+10+0.222+10+2.469=26.691$ minutes.

The final standings are already known: the participant in the $i$-th place solved $p_i$ problems. Since the participants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then $p_1 \\ge p_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge p_n$.\n\nHelp the jury distribute the gold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be $g$, $s$ and $b$, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which all must be satisfied:  for each of the three types of medals, at least one medal must be awarded (that is, $g>0$, $s>0$ and $b>0$);  the number of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the number of bronze (that is, $g<s$ and $g<b$, but there are no requirements between $s$ and $b$);  each gold medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal;  each silver medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal;  each bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant not awarded a medal;  the total number of medalists $g+s+b$ should not exceed half of all participants (for example, if $n=21$, then you can award a maximum of $10$ participants, and if $n=26$, then you can award a maximum of $13$ participants). \n\nThe jury wants to reward with medals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize $g+s+b$) so that all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a way to award medals.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10000$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 4\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of BeRC participants. The second line of a test case contains integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($0 \\le p_i \\le 10^6$), where $p_i$ is equal to the number of problems solved by the $i$-th participant from the final standings. The values $p_i$ are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e. $p_1 \\ge p_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge p_n$.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $4\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ lines, the $j$-th line should contain the answer to the $j$-th test case.\n\nThe answer consists of three non-negative integers $g, s, b$.  Print $g=s=b=0$ if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that all requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time.  Otherwise, print three positive numbers $g, s, b$ \u2014 the possible number of gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of $g+s+b$ should be the maximum possible.

In this case, the participant solved $5$ tasks will be rewarded with the gold medal, participants solved $4$ tasks will be rewarded with silver medals, participants solved $2$ or $3$ tasks will be rewarded with bronze medals. Participants solved exactly $1$ task won't be rewarded. It's easy to see, that in this case, all conditions are satisfied and it is possible to reward participants in this way. It is impossible to give more than $6$ medals because the number of medals should not exceed half of the number of participants.

There are $n$ problems in it, and a lot of robots are going to participate in it. Each robot solving the problem $i$ gets $p_i$ points, and the score of each robot in the competition is calculated as the sum of $p_i$ over all problems $i$ solved by it. For each problem, $p_i$ is an integer not less than $1$.\n\nTwo corporations specializing in problem-solving robot manufacturing, \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" and \"BionicSolver Industries\", are going to register two robots (one for each corporation) for participation as well. Polycarp knows the advantages and flaws of robots produced by these companies, so, for each problem, he knows precisely whether each robot will solve it during the competition. Knowing this, he can try predicting the results \u2014 or manipulating them. \n\nFor some reason (which absolutely cannot involve bribing), Polycarp wants the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot to outperform the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot in the competition. Polycarp wants to set the values of $p_i$ in such a way that the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot gets strictly more points than the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot. However, if the values of $p_i$ will be large, it may look very suspicious \u2014 so Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum value of $p_i$ over all problems. Can you help Polycarp to determine the minimum possible upper bound on the number of points given for solving the problems?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of problems.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $r_1$, $r_2$, ..., $r_n$ ($0 \\le r_i \\le 1$). $r_i = 1$ means that the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot will solve the $i$-th problem, $r_i = 0$ means that it won't solve the $i$-th problem.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1$, $b_2$, ..., $b_n$ ($0 \\le b_i \\le 1$). $b_i = 1$ means that the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot will solve the $i$-th problem, $b_i = 0$ means that it won't solve the $i$-th problem.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot cannot outperform the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot by any means, print one integer $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print the minimum possible value of $\\max \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} p_i$, if all values of $p_i$ are set in such a way that the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot gets strictly more points than the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n9\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, one of the valid score assignments is $p = [3, 1, 3, 1, 1]$.

That is why Levko is playing with array a, performing all sorts of operations with it. Each operation Levko performs is of one of two types:\n\n  Increase all elements from l_{i} to r_{i} by d_{i}. In other words, perform assignments a_{j} = a_{j} + d_{i} for all j that meet the inequation l_{i} \u2264 j \u2264 r_{i}.  Find the maximum of elements from l_{i} to r_{i}. That is, calculate the value $m_{i} = \\operatorname{max}_{j = l_{i}}^{r_{i}} a_{j}$. \n\nSadly, Levko has recently lost his array. Fortunately, Levko has records of all operations he has performed on array a. Help Levko, given the operation records, find at least one suitable array. The results of all operations for the given array must coincide with the record results. Levko clearly remembers that all numbers in his array didn't exceed 10^9 in their absolute value, so he asks you to find such an array.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5000) \u2014 the size of the array and the number of operations in Levko's records, correspondingly.\n\nNext m lines describe the operations, the i-th line describes the i-th operation. The first integer in the i-th line is integer t_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 2) that describes the operation type. If t_{i} = 1, then it is followed by three integers l_{i}, r_{i} and d_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n,  - 10^4 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the description of the operation of the first type. If t_{i} = 2, then it is followed by three integers l_{i}, r_{i} and m_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n,  - 5\u00b710^7 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 5\u00b710^7) \u2014 the description of the operation of the second type.\n\nThe operations are given in the order Levko performed them on his array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the solution exists and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the solution exists, then on the second line print n integers a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n} (|a_{i}| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the recovered array.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 3 1\n2 1 2 8\n2 3 4 7\n1 1 3 3\n2 3 4 8\n\nOutput\nYES\n4 7 4 7\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 3 1\n2 1 2 8\n2 3 4 7\n1 1 3 3\n2 3 4 13\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nAnswer:\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = [10**9 for _ in range(n)]\nextra = [0 for _ in range(n)]\nquery = list()\nfor _ in range(m):\n     t, l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n     l -= 1\n     r -= 1\n     query.append((t, l, r, x))\n     if t == 1:\n          for j in range(l, r + 1):\n               extra[j] += x\n     else:\n          for j in range(l, r + 1):\n               a[j] = min(a[j], x - extra[j])\nextra = a.copy()\nfor t, l, r, x in query:\n     if t == 1:\n          for j in range(l, r + 1):\n               a[j] += x\n     else:\n          val = -10**9\n          for j in range(l, r + 1):\n               val = max(val, a[j])\n          if not val == x:\n               print('NO')\n               return\n\nprint('YES')\nfor x in extra:\n     print(x, end=' ')\n          \n\nQUESTION:\nThe little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.\n\nOne day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of n elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are q queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n).

She is responsible for creating a departure schedule. There are n flights that must depart today, the i-th of them is planned to depart at the i-th minute of the day.\n\nMetropolis airport is the main transport hub of Metropolia, so it is difficult to keep the schedule intact. This is exactly the case today: because of technical issues, no flights were able to depart during the first k minutes of the day, so now the new departure schedule must be created.\n\nAll n scheduled flights must now depart at different minutes between (k + 1)-th and (k + n)-th, inclusive. However, it's not mandatory for the flights to depart in the same order they were initially scheduled to do so\u00a0\u2014 their order in the new schedule can be different. There is only one restriction: no flight is allowed to depart earlier than it was supposed to depart in the initial schedule.\n\nHelen knows that each minute of delay of the i-th flight costs airport c_{i} burles. Help her find the order for flights to depart in the new schedule that minimizes the total cost for the airport.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 300 000), here n is the number of flights, and k is the number of minutes in the beginning of the day that the flights did not depart.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^7), here c_{i} is the cost of delaying the i-th flight for one minute.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line must contain the minimum possible total cost of delaying the flights.\n\nThe second line must contain n different integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (k + 1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 k + n), here t_{i} is the minute when the i-th flight must depart.

There is an integer on each of the cards, this integer is between 1 and 100 000, inclusive. It is possible that some cards have the same integers on them.\n\nVasily decided to sort the cards. To do this, he repeatedly takes the top card from the deck, and if the number on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then he places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the next card from the top, and so on. The process ends as soon as there are no cards in the deck. You can assume that Vasily always knows the minimum number written on some card in the remaining deck, but doesn't know where this card (or these cards) is.\n\nYou are to determine the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of cards in the deck.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100 000), where a_{i} is the number written on the i-th from top card in the deck.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n6 3 1 2\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n1\n1000\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Vasily at first looks at the card with number 6 on it, puts it under the deck, then on the card with number 3, puts it under the deck, and then on the card with number 1.

Then Vasily looks at the top card with number 2 and puts it away. After that the cards from top to bottom are [6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at card 6, puts it under the deck, then at card 3 and puts it away. Then there is only one card with number 6 on it, and Vasily looks at it and puts it away.

The boxes stood in a row and were numbered with numbers from 1 to n from left to right.\n\nOnce Vasya chose one of the boxes, let's assume that its number is i, took all balls out from it (it is guaranteed that this box originally had at least one ball), and began putting balls (one at a time) to the boxes with numbers i + 1, i + 2, i + 3 and so on. If Vasya puts a ball into the box number n, then the next ball goes to box 1, the next one goes to box 2 and so on. He did it until he had no balls left in his hands. It is possible that Vasya puts multiple balls to the same box, and it is also possible that one or more balls will go to the box number i. If i = n, Vasya puts the first ball into the box number 1, then the next ball goes to box 2 and so on. \n\nFor example, let's suppose that initially Vasya had four boxes, and the first box had 3 balls, the second one had 2, the third one had 5 and the fourth one had 4 balls. Then, if i = 3, then Vasya will take all five balls out of the third box and put them in the boxes with numbers: 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. After all Vasya's actions the balls will lie in the boxes as follows: in the first box there are 4 balls, 3 in the second one, 1 in the third one and 6 in the fourth one.\n\nAt this point Vasya has completely forgotten the original arrangement of the balls in the boxes, but he knows how they are arranged now, and the number x \u2014 the number of the box, where he put the last of the taken out balls.\n\nHe asks you to help to find the initial arrangement of the balls in the boxes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and x (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), that represent the number of the boxes and the index of the box that got the last ball from Vasya, correspondingly.

There $x, y$ are integers greater than or equal to $0$. For example, sequences $[]$, $[2]$, $[1, 1]$, $[1, 2, 1]$, $[1, 2, 2, 1]$ and $[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]$ are three block palindromes but $[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$, $[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]$ and $[1, 2]$ are not.\n\nYour task is to choose the maximum by length subsequence of $a$ that is a three blocks palindrome.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\nRecall that the sequence $t$ is a a subsequence of the sequence $s$ if $t$ can be derived from $s$ by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if $s=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, then possible subsequences are: $[1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[3]$ and $[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, but not $[3, 2, 3]$ and $[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2000$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2000$) \u2014 the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 26$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$. Note that the maximum value of $a_i$ can be up to $26$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$ ($\\sum n \\le 2000$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the maximum possible length of some subsequence of $a$ that is a three blocks palindrome.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n8\n1 1 2 2 3 2 1 1\n3\n1 3 3\n4\n1 10 10 1\n1\n26\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n7\n2\n4\n1\n1\n3\n\nAnswer:\n#!usr\/bin\/env python3\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nfrom heapq import heappush, heappop\nfrom itertools import permutations, accumulate\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport bisect\ndef LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\ndef I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\ndef LS():return [list(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\ndef S():\n    res = list(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if res[-1] == \"\\n\":\n        return res[:-1]\n    return res\ndef IR(n):\n    return [I() for i in range(n)]\ndef LIR(n):\n    return [LI() for i in range(n)]\ndef SR(n):\n    return [S() for i in range(n)]\ndef LSR(n):\n    return [LS() for i in range(n)]\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\nmod = 1000000007\n\ndef solve():\n    def f(a,b):\n        if a == b:\n            return len(d[a])\n        da = d[a]\n        db = d[b]\n        res = 0\n        for x in range(len(da) >> 1):\n            l = da[x]\n            r = da[-1-x]\n            i = bisect.bisect_left(db,l)\n            j = bisect.bisect_left(db,r)\n            y = max(0,j-i)\n            s = 2*(x+1)+y\n            if res < s:\n                res = s\n        return res\n\n    t = I()\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = I()\n        a = LI()\n        m = max(a)\n        d = [[] for i in range(m)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            ai = a[i]-1\n            d[ai].append(i)\n        ans = 1\n        for a in range(m):\n            if not d[a]:\n                continue\n            for b in range(m):\n                if not d[b]:\n                    continue\n                res = f(a,b)\n                if ans < res:\n                    ans = res\n        print(ans)\n    return\n\n#Solve\ndef __starting_point():\n    solve()\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nYou are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.\n\nA time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.\n\nNote that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.\n\nFormally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x\u00b7y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.\n\nJamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 60).\n\nThe second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 \u2264 hh \u2264 23, 00 \u2264 mm \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n11 23\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n01 07\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23.

This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line string without any space or numeric or special characters.\n\n-----Output-----\nIt will consist of in the encrypted string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string in order.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\ninformation\n\nOutput:\ni2n2f1o2r1m1a1t1\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys,math\n\ndef main(filename):\n inputfile = open(filename,'rU')\n data = inputfile.readlines()\n T=data.pop(0)\n ans=[]\n ansstring=str()\n explored=[]\n for i in T:\n  if i in explored:\n   #print explored\n   for j in range(len(ans)):\n    if ans[j][0]==i:\n     ans[j][1] += 1\n  else:\n   ans.append([i,1])\n   explored.append(i)\n for i in ans:\n  ansstring += i[0]+str(i[1])\n print(ansstring) \n   \n\n\n inputfile.close()\n\ndef __starting_point():\n main(sys.argv[1])\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nForrest lives in a prehistoric era of \u201cdial-up Internet.\u201d Unlike the fast streaming of today\u2019s broadband era, dial-up connections are only capable of transmitting small amounts of text data at reasonable speeds. Forrest has noticed that his communications typically include repeated characters, and has designed a simple compression scheme based on repeated information. Text data is encoded for transmission, possibly resulting in a much shorter data string, and decoded after transmission to reveal the original data.\n\nThe compression scheme is rather simple. When encoding a text string, repeated consecutive characters are replaced by a single instance of that character and the number of occurrences of that character (the character\u2019s run length). Decoding the encoded string results in the original string by repeating each character the number of times encoded by the run length. Forrest calls this encoding scheme run-length encoding. (We don\u2019t think he was actually the first person to invent it, but we haven\u2019t mentioned that to him.)\n\nFor example, the string HHHeelllo is encoded as H3e2l3o1.

The line starts with a single letter: E for encode or D for decode. This letter is followed by a single space and then a message. The message consists of $1$ to $100$ characters.\n\nEach string to encode contains only upper- and lowercase English letters, underscores, periods, and exclamation points. No consecutive sequence of characters exceeds $9$ repetitions.\n\nEach string to decode has even length. Its characters alternate between the same characters as strings to encode and a single digit between $1$ and $9$, indicating the run length for the preceding character.\n\n-----Output-----\nOn an input of E output the run-length encoding of the provided message.

They have to give him an integer N and he will immediately respond with a number which has more than N factors.\nWhat the prodigy really does is to do some complex calculations in his head to find out the smallest integer with more than N factors. However, he has a weakness - he knows to do those calculation only on numbers up to 1019, so if the answer to be reported is more than 1019, he will not be able to come up with his solution and will lose the game.\nGiven the integer the people give to the prodigy, you need to report whether he wins the game or not.

Soliman will make the first move. The player who can't make a move loses.\n\nIn each move, the current player will pick a single node, take a non-empty subset of apples from it and do one of the following two things:  eat the apples, if the node is a leaf.  move the apples to one of the children, if the node is non-leaf. \n\nBefore Soliman comes to start playing, Sagheer will make exactly one change to the tree. He will pick two different nodes u and v and swap the apples of u with the apples of v.\n\nCan you help Sagheer count the number of ways to make the swap (i.e. to choose u and v) after which he will win the game if both players play optimally?

Node i has parent p_{i} (for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Node 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input describes a valid tree, and the lengths of all paths from the root to any leaf will have the same parity.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn a single line, print the number of different pairs of nodes (u, v), u \u2260 v such that if they start playing after swapping the apples of both nodes, Sagheer will win the game.

In this case, both leaves will have 2 apples. If Soliman makes a move in a leaf node, Sagheer can make the same move in the other leaf. If Soliman moved some apples from a root to a leaf, Sagheer will eat those moved apples. Eventually, Soliman will not find a move.\n\nIn the second sample, There is no swap that will make Sagheer win the game.\n\nNote that Sagheer must make the swap even if he can win with the initial tree.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

The player who can't make a move loses.\n\nIn each move, the current player will pick a single node, take a non-empty subset of apples from it and do one of the following two things:  eat the apples, if the node is a leaf.  move the apples to one of the children, if the node is non-leaf. \n\nBefore Soliman comes to start playing, Sagheer will make exactly one change to the tree. He will pick two different nodes u and v and swap the apples of u with the apples of v.\n\nCan you help Sagheer count the number of ways to make the swap (i.e. to choose u and v) after which he will win the game if both players play optimally? (u, v) and (v, u) are considered to be the same pair.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line will contain one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of nodes in the apple tree.\n\nThe second line will contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the number of apples on each node of the tree.\n\nThe third line will contain n - 1 integers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the parent of each node of the tree. Node i has parent p_{i} (for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Node 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input describes a valid tree, and the lengths of all paths from the root to any leaf will have the same parity.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn a single line, print the number of different pairs of nodes (u, v), u \u2260 v such that if they start playing after swapping the apples of both nodes, Sagheer will win the game. (u, v) and (v, u) are considered to be the same pair.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 2 3\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n8\n7 2 2 5 4 3 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 5 6\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Sagheer can only win if he swapped node 1 with node 3. In this case, both leaves will have 2 apples. If Soliman makes a move in a leaf node, Sagheer can make the same move in the other leaf. If Soliman moved some apples from a root to a leaf, Sagheer will eat those moved apples. Eventually, Soliman will not find a move.\n\nIn the second sample, There is no swap that will make Sagheer win the game.\n\nNote that Sagheer must make the swap even if he can win with the initial tree.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

But, he doesn't want to tell Tolik about his inability to solve it, so he hasn't found anything better than asking you how to solve this task.\n\nIn this task you are given a cell field $n \\cdot m$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, where point's coordinates $(x, y)$ mean it is situated in the $x$-th row and $y$-th column, considering numeration from one ($1 \\leq x \\leq n, 1 \\leq y \\leq m$). Initially, you stand in the cell $(1, 1)$. Every move you can jump from cell $(x, y)$, which you stand in, by any non-zero vector $(dx, dy)$, thus you will stand in the $(x+dx, y+dy)$ cell. Obviously, you can't leave the field, but also there is one more important condition\u00a0\u2014 you're not allowed to use one vector twice. Your task is to visit each cell of the field exactly once (the initial cell is considered as already visited).\n\nTolik's uncle is a very respectful person.

He also is a favorite of the \"Bizons\" team.\n\nAt a competition the \"Bizons\" got the following problem: \"You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), s and t. You need to transform word s into word t\". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it?

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\n$n$ robots have escaped from your laboratory! You have to find them as soon as possible, because these robots are experimental, and their behavior is not tested yet, so they may be really dangerous!\n\nFortunately, even though your robots have escaped, you still have some control over them. First of all, you know the location of each robot: the world you live in can be modeled as an infinite coordinate plane, and the $i$-th robot is currently located at the point having coordinates ($x_i$, $y_i$). Furthermore, you may send exactly one command to all of the robots. The command should contain two integer numbers $X$ and $Y$, and when each robot receives this command, it starts moving towards the point having coordinates ($X$, $Y$). The robot stops its movement in two cases:  either it reaches ($X$, $Y$);  or it cannot get any closer to ($X$, $Y$). \n\nNormally, all robots should be able to get from any point of the coordinate plane to any other point. Each robot usually can perform four actions to move. Let's denote the current coordinates of the robot as ($x_c$, $y_c$). Then the movement system allows it to move to any of the four adjacent points:  the first action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c - 1$, $y_c$);  the second action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c$, $y_c + 1$);  the third action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c + 1$, $y_c$);  the fourth action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c$, $y_c - 1$). \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that some movement systems of some robots are malfunctioning. For each robot you know which actions it can perform, and which it cannot perform.\n\nYou want to send a command so all robots gather at the same point. To do so, you have to choose a pair of integer numbers $X$ and $Y$ so that each robot can reach the point ($X$, $Y$). Is it possible to find such a point?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThen $q$ queries follow. Each query begins with one line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of robots in the query. Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of these lines describes the $i$-th robot in the current query: it contains six integer numbers $x_i$, $y_i$, $f_{i, 1}$, $f_{i, 2}$, $f_{i, 3}$ and $f_{i, 4}$ ($-10^5 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^5$, $0 \\le f_{i, j} \\le 1$). The first two numbers describe the initial location of the $i$-th robot, and the following four numbers describe which actions the $i$-th robot can use to move ($f_{i, j} = 1$ if the $i$-th robot can use the $j$-th action, and $f_{i, j} = 0$ if it cannot use the $j$-th action).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of robots over all queries does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nYou should answer each query independently, in the order these queries appear in the input.\n\nTo answer a query, you should do one of the following:  if it is impossible to find a point that is reachable by all $n$ robots, print one number $0$ on a separate line;  if it is possible to find a point that is reachable by all $n$ robots, print three space-separated integers on the same line: $1$ $X$ $Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are the coordinates of the point reachable by all $n$ robots. Both $X$ and $Y$ should not exceed $10^5$ by absolute value; it is guaranteed that if there exists at least one point reachable by all robots, then at least one of such points has both coordinates not exceeding $10^5$ by absolute value.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n2\n-1 -2 0 0 0 0\n-1 -2 0 0 0 0\n3\n1 5 1 1 1 1\n2 5 0 1 0 1\n3 5 1 0 0 0\n2\n1337 1337 0 1 1 1\n1336 1337 1 1 0 1\n1\n3 5 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1 -1 -2\n1 2 5\n0\n1 -100000 -100000\n\nAnswer:\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.readline\n    \n    def solve():\n        n = int(input())\n        maxx = 10**5\n        minx = -10**5\n        maxy = 10**5\n        miny = -10**5\n        \n        for _ in range(n):\n            x, y, f1, f2, f3, f4 = map(int, input().split())\n            if not f1:\n                minx = max(minx, x)\n            if not f2:\n                maxy = min(maxy, y)\n            if not f3:\n                maxx = min(maxx, x)\n            if not f4:\n                miny = max(miny, y)\n        \n        if minx > maxx or miny > maxy:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            print(1, minx, miny)\n        \n    \n    for _ in range(int(input())):\n        solve()\n    \n    return 0\n\nmain()\n\nQUESTION:\nAfter the war, the supersonic rocket became the most common public transportation.\n\nEach supersonic rocket consists of two \"engines\". Each engine is a set of \"power sources\". The first engine has $n$ power sources, and the second one has $m$ power sources. A power source can be described as a point $(x_i, y_i)$ on a 2-D plane. All points in each engine are different.\n\nYou can manipulate each engine separately. There are two operations that you can do with each engine. You can do each operation as many times as you want. For every power source as a whole in that engine: $(x_i, y_i)$ becomes $(x_i+a, y_i+b)$, $a$ and $b$ can be any real numbers. In other words, all power sources will be shifted. For every power source as a whole in that engine: $(x_i, y_i)$ becomes $(x_i \\cos \\theta - y_i \\sin \\theta, x_i \\sin \\theta + y_i \\cos \\theta)$, $\\theta$ can be any real number. In other words, all power sources will be rotated.\n\nThe engines work as follows: after the two engines are powered, their power sources are being combined (here power sources of different engines may coincide). If two power sources $A(x_a, y_a)$ and $B(x_b, y_b)$ exist, then for all real number $k$ that $0 \\lt k \\lt 1$, a new power source will be created $C_k(kx_a+(1-k)x_b,ky_a+(1-k)y_b)$. Then, this procedure will be repeated again with all new and old power sources. After that, the \"power field\" from all power sources will be generated (can be considered as an infinite set of all power sources occurred).\n\nA supersonic rocket is \"safe\" if and only if after you manipulate the engines, destroying any power source and then power the engine, the power field generated won't be changed (comparing to the situation where no power source erased).

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nThis is probably the simplest problem ever. You just need to count the number of ordered triples of different numbers (X1, X2, X3), where Xi could be any positive integer from 1 to Ni, inclusive (i = 1, 2, 3).\nNo, wait. I forgot to mention that numbers N1, N2, N3 could be up to 1018. Well, in any case it is still quite simple :)\nBy the way, because of this the answer could be quite large. Hence you should output it modulo 109 + 7. That is you need to find the remainder of the division of the number of required triples by 109 + 7.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N1, N2, N3.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of required triples modulo 109 + 7.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n- 1 \u2264 Ni \u2264 1018\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5\n3 3 3\n2 4 2\n1 2 3\n25 12 2012\n1 1 2013\n\nOutput:\n6\n4\n1\n578880\n0\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. We have the following triples composed of different numbers up to 3:\n(1, 2, 3)\n(1, 3, 2)\n(2, 1, 3)\n(2, 3, 1)\n(3, 1, 2)\n(3, 2, 1)\nExample case 2. Here the triples are:\n(1, 3, 2)\n(1, 4, 2)\n(2, 3, 1)\n(2, 4, 1)\nExample case 3. Here the only triple is (1, 2, 3).\nExample case 4. Merry Christmas! \nExample case 5. ... and Happy New Year! By the way here the answer is zero since the only choice for X1 and for is X2 is 1, so any such triple will have equal numbers.\n\nAnswer:\nd=1000000007\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n l=sorted(list(map(int,input().split())))\n ans=(l[0]%d)*((l[1]-1)%d)*((l[2]-2)%d)\n print(ans%d)\n\nQUESTION:\nYou are given two integers K and S.\n\nThree variable X, Y and Z takes integer values satisfying 0\u2264X,Y,Z\u2264K.\n\nHow many different assignments of values to X, Y and Z are there such that X + Y + Z = S?  \n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2\u2264K\u22642500 \n - 0\u2264S\u22643K \n - K and S are integers.  \n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nK S\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of the triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n6\n\nThere are six triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition:\n - X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 2 \n - X = 0, Y = 2, Z = 0 \n - X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 0 \n - X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 1 \n - X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1 \n - X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 0\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer $k > 1$ such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by $k$. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. \n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible.

To each sweet type $i$, he has assigned a target fraction, which is a real number $f_ i$ ($0 < f_ i \\le 1$). He wants the fraction of sweets of type $i$ among all sweets he has eaten to be roughly equal to $f_ i$. To be more precise, let $s_ i$ denote the number of sweets of type $i$ that Danny has eaten, and let $n = \\sum _{i=1}^m s_ i$.

The new price $b_i$ of each product $i$ should be positive (i.e. $b_i > 0$ should be satisfied for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$).\n\nYour task is to find out the maximum possible equal price $B$ of all productts with the restriction that for all products the condiion $|a_i - B| \\le k$ should be satisfied (where $a_i$ is the old price of the product and $B$ is the same new price of all products) or report that it is impossible to find such price $B$.\n\nNote that the chosen price $B$ should be integer.\n\nYou should answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of queries. Each query is presented by two lines.\n\nThe first line of the query contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100, 1 \\le k \\le 10^8$) \u2014 the number of products and the value $k$. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^8$), where $a_i$ is the price of the $i$-th product.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ integers, where the $i$-th integer is the answer $B$ on the $i$-th query.\n\nIf it is impossible to equalize prices of all given products with restriction that for all products the condition $|a_i - B| \\le k$ should be satisfied (where $a_i$ is the old price of the product and $B$ is the new equal price of all products), print -1. Otherwise print the maximum possible equal price of all products.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5 1\n1 1 2 3 1\n4 2\n6 4 8 5\n2 2\n1 6\n3 5\n5 2 5\n\nOutput\n2\n6\n-1\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example query you can choose the price $B=2$. It is easy to see that the difference between each old price and each new price $B=2$ is no more than $1$.\n\nIn the second example query you can choose the price $B=6$ and then all the differences between old and new price $B=6$ will be no more than $2$.\n\nIn the third example query you cannot choose any suitable price $B$. For any value $B$ at least one condition out of two will be violated: $|1-B| \\le 2$, $|6-B| \\le 2$.\n\nIn the fourth example query all values $B$ between $1$ and $7$ are valid. But the maximum is $7$, so it's the answer.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

Once while he was reading one book, he became acquainted with an unusual character. The character told about himself like that: \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir among the Elves, Thark\u00fbn to the Dwarves, Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.\"\n\nAnd at that moment Sasha thought, how would that character be called in the East? In the East all names are palindromes. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, such strings as \"kazak\", \"oo\" and \"r\" are palindromes, but strings \"abb\" and \"ij\" are not. \n\nSasha believed that the hero would be named after one of the gods of the East. As long as there couldn't be two equal names, so in the East people did the following: they wrote the original name as a string on a piece of paper, then cut the paper minimum number of times $k$, so they got $k+1$ pieces of paper with substrings of the initial string, and then unite those pieces together to get a new string. Pieces couldn't be turned over, they could be shuffled.\n\nIn this way, it's possible to achive a string abcdefg from the string f|de|abc|g using $3$ cuts (by swapping papers with substrings f and abc). The string cbadefg can't be received using the same cuts.\n\nMore formally, Sasha wants for the given palindrome $s$ find such minimum $k$, that you can cut this string into $k + 1$ parts, and then unite them in such a way that the final string will be a palindrome and it won't be equal to the initial string $s$. It there is no answer, then print \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 5\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial name, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that $s$ is a palindrome.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer $k$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of cuts needed to get a new name, or \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nnolon\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\notto\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\nqqqq\n\nOutput\nImpossible\n\nInput\nkinnikkinnik\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can cut the string in those positions: no|l|on, and then unite them as follows on|l|no. It can be shown that there is no solution with one cut.\n\nIn the second example, you can cut the string right in the middle, and swap peaces, so you get toot.\n\nIn the third example, you can't make a string, that won't be equal to the initial one.\n\nIn the fourth example, you can cut the suffix nik and add it to the beginning, so you get nikkinnikkin.\n\nAnswer:\n\ndef solve(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        s2 = s[i:] + s[:i]\n        # print(s2)\n        if s != s2 and s2[::-1] == s2:\n            return 1\n\n    for i in range( (n \/\/ 2) + 1, n):\n        if s[i] != s[0]:\n            return 2\n        # print(s[i])\n    return \"Impossible\"\n\ns = input()\nprint(solve(s))\n\n\nQUESTION:\nValya and Tolya are an ideal pair, but they quarrel sometimes.

Usually, a caterpillar sits on leaf, eats as much of it as it can (or wants), then stretches out to its full length to reach a new leaf with its front end, and finally \"hops\" to it by contracting its back end to that leaf.\nWe have with us a very long, straight branch of a tree with leaves distributed uniformly along its length, and a set of caterpillars sitting on the first leaf. (Well, our leaves are big enough to accommodate upto $20$ caterpillars!). As time progresses our caterpillars eat and hop repeatedly, thereby damaging many leaves. Not all caterpillars are of the same length, so different caterpillars may eat different sets of leaves. We would like to find out the number of leaves that will be undamaged at the end of this eating spree. We assume that adjacent leaves are a unit distance apart and the length of the caterpillars is also given in the same unit.\nFor example suppose our branch had $20$ leaves (placed $1$ unit apart) and $3$ caterpillars of length $3, 2$ and $5$ units respectively. Then, first caterpillar would first eat leaf $1$, then hop to leaf $4$ and eat it and then hop to leaf $7$ and eat it and so on. So the first caterpillar would end up eating the leaves at positions $1,4,7,10,13,16$ and $19$. The second caterpillar would eat the leaves at positions $1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17$ and $19$. The third caterpillar would eat the leaves at positions $1,6,11$ and $16$. Thus we would have undamaged leaves at positions $2,8,12,14,18$ and $20$. So the answer to this example is $6$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, where $N$ is the number of leaves and $K$ is the number of caterpillars. Lines $2,3,...,K+1$ describe the lengths of the $K$ caterpillars. Line $i+1$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq K$) contains a single integer representing the length of the $i^{th}$ caterpillar.\n\n-----Output:-----\nA line containing a single integer, which is the number of leaves left on the branch after all the caterpillars have finished their eating spree.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000000000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 20$.\n- The length of the caterpillars lie between $1$ and $N$.\n- $50 \\%$ of test cases will also satisfy $1 \\leq N \\leq 10000000$ and $1 \\leq K \\leq 16$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n20 3\n3\n2\n5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6\n\n-----Hint:-----\nYou may use $64$-bit integers (long long in C\/C++) to avoid errors while multiplying large integers.

They want to eat all berries of this tree. These birds quickly alight on some leaves of the tree and eat all berries at where they stand. Now they are thinking of who will eat other berries \u2026\n\nSince the flock has some giant birds and some tiny birds, and they observe that the tree has some big branches and some small branches, fairly distributing these berries among all birds turns out to be a tough problem.\n\nFormally, the tree of elderberries can be presented as a tree with the following properties:\n - The tree has $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. The root of the tree is vertex $1$.\n - Each non-leaf vertex (vertex having at least one child) is called a branch. A branch is classified as either big or small. The root is always a big branch.\n - On each leaf of the tree, there is either one giant bird, one tiny bird or one elderberry.\n\nThe process of determining which bird eats which berry is as below:\n - First, every bird and every berry has a label. A label is a non-empty string of at most five lowercase English characters.\n - Second, every bird has a controlled area.

Hence, at least one bird\u2019s label needs changing. We can change the label of the bird at vertex $6$ to \u2018c\u2019.

Now they are thinking of who will eat other berries \u2026\n\nSince the flock has some giant birds and some tiny birds, and they observe that the tree has some big branches and some small branches, fairly distributing these berries among all birds turns out to be a tough problem.\n\nFormally, the tree of elderberries can be presented as a tree with the following properties:\n - The tree has $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. The root of the tree is vertex $1$.\n - Each non-leaf vertex (vertex having at least one child) is called a branch. A branch is classified as either big or small. The root is always a big branch.\n - On each leaf of the tree, there is either one giant bird, one tiny bird or one elderberry.\n\nThe process of determining which bird eats which berry is as below:\n - First, every bird and every berry has a label.

Consider the bird at vertex $v$:\n - If it is a tiny bird, its controlled area is the subtree rooted at vertex $p_ v$, where $p_ v$ is the parent of $v$.\n - If it is a giant bird, its controlled area is the subtree rooted at vertex $b_ v$, where $b_ v$ is the closest vertex to $v$ among all ancestors of $v$ which are big branches.\n - Finally, for each berry, the bird who eats it is determined using the following rules:\n - A bird can only eat berries having the same label with it.\n - A bird can only eat berries inside its controlled area.\n - If there is more than one bird satisfying the two above conditions, only one bird with smallest controlled area eats it.\n\nAll birds also set some rules for labeling birds and berries:\n - A bird or a berry can have same label with other birds and berries.

The rules follow.\n\nA positive integer $a$ is initially on the screen. The player can put a coin into the machine and then add $1$ to or subtract $1$ from any two adjacent digits. All digits must remain from $0$ to $9$ after this operation, and the leading digit must not equal zero. In other words, it is forbidden to add $1$ to $9$, to subtract $1$ from $0$ and to subtract $1$ from the leading $1$. Once the number on the screen becomes equal to $b$, the player wins the jackpot. $a$ and $b$ have the same number of digits.\n\nHelp the player to determine the minimal number of coins he needs to spend in order to win the jackpot and tell how to play.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) standing for the length of numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe next two lines contain numbers $a$ and $b$, each one on a separate line ($10^{n-1} \\le a, b < 10^n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to win the jackpot, print a single integer $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, the first line must contain the minimal possible number $c$ of coins the player has to spend.\n\n$\\min(c, 10^5)$ lines should follow, $i$-th of them containing two integers $d_i$ and $s_i$ ($1\\le d_i\\le n - 1$, $s_i = \\pm 1$) denoting that on the $i$-th step the player should add $s_i$ to the $d_i$-th and $(d_i + 1)$-st digits from the left (e. g. $d_i = 1$ means that two leading digits change while $d_i = n - 1$ means that there are two trailing digits which change).\n\nPlease notice that the answer may be very big and in case $c > 10^5$ you should print only the first $10^5$ moves. Your answer is considered correct if it is possible to finish your printed moves to win the jackpot in the minimal possible number of coins.

When speedrunning, you usually follow a pre-planned path through the game. Along this path, there may be some places where you have to pull off a difficult technique, or trick, which may cause a delay if you fail to pull it off successfully. Luckily you can reset the game at any time: if you have made a few mistakes, you can start a new run, losing your progress but instantaneously starting over with a clean slate. You can do this as often as you like.\n\nThe game you are currently speedrunning has a record of $r$ seconds, which you intend to beat. You have discovered a path through the game that, in the best case, takes $n < r$ seconds. There are some tricks along the way, though: you know exactly where along the run they occur, what the probability is that you will pull them off successfully, and how many seconds you have to spend to recover if they fail.\n\nGiven this data, you want to find the optimal strategy for when to reset the game to minimise the expected time to set a new record. Write a program to determine what this smallest possible expected time is.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with three integers $n$, $r$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n < r \\leq 5000$, $1 \\le m \\le 50$), where $n$ and $r$ are as described above and $m$ is the number of tricks.\n - $m$ lines, each containing three numbers describing a trick:\n - An integer $t$ ($1 \\le t < n$), the time in the route (assuming no failed tricks before) at which the trick occurs,\n - a real number $p$ ($0 < p < 1$ and $p$ has at most $6$ digits after the decimal point), the probability that the trick succeeds, and\n - an integer $d$ ($1 \\le d \\le 1000$), the number of seconds required to recover in case the trick fails.\n\nThe tricks are given in sorted order by $t$, and no two tricks occur at the same time $t$ in the route.\n\nYou may assume that, without resetting, a single playthrough has a probability of at least $1$ in $50000$ to succeed at improving the record.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the expected time you will have to play the game to set a new record, assuming an optimal strategy is used. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.Explanation of Sample Input 1\n\nThe record for this game is $111$ seconds, and your route takes $100$ seconds if everything goes right.\n\nAfter playing for $20$ seconds, there is a trick with a $50\\% $ success rate. If it succeeds, you keep playing. If it fails, you incur a $10$ second time loss: now the run will take at least $110$ seconds. It is still possible to set a record, but every other trick in the run has to be successful. It turns out to be faster on average to reset after failing the first trick.\n\nThus you repeat the first $20$ seconds of the game until the trick is successful: with probability $1\/2$, it takes $1$ attempt; with probability $1\/4$, it takes $2$ attempts; and so on. On average, you spend $40$ seconds on the first $20$ seconds of the route.\n\nOnce you have successfully performed the first trick, you want to finish the run no matter the result of the other tricks: it takes $80$ seconds, plus on average $1$ second loss from each of the remaining $4$ tricks. So the expected time until you set a record is $124$ seconds.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n100 111 5\n20 0.5 10\n80 0.5 2\n85 0.5 2\n90 0.5 2\n95 0.5 2\nSample Output 1:\n124\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 4 1\n1 0.5 5\nSample Output 2:\n3\n\nSample Input 3:\n10 20 3\n5 0.3 8\n6 0.8 3\n8 0.9 3\nSample Output 3:\n18.9029850746\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

If it succeeds, you keep playing. If it fails, you incur a $10$ second time loss: now the run will take at least $110$ seconds. It is still possible to set a record, but every other trick in the run has to be successful. It turns out to be faster on average to reset after failing the first trick.\n\nThus you repeat the first $20$ seconds of the game until the trick is successful: with probability $1\/2$, it takes $1$ attempt; with probability $1\/4$, it takes $2$ attempts; and so on. On average, you spend $40$ seconds on the first $20$ seconds of the route.\n\nOnce you have successfully performed the first trick, you want to finish the run no matter the result of the other tricks: it takes $80$ seconds, plus on average $1$ second loss from each of the remaining $4$ tricks. So the expected time until you set a record is $124$ seconds.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n100 111 5\n20 0.5 10\n80 0.5 2\n85 0.5 2\n90 0.5 2\n95 0.5 2\nSample Output 1:\n124\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 4 1\n1 0.5 5\nSample Output 2:\n3\n\nSample Input 3:\n10 20 3\n5 0.3 8\n6 0.8 3\n8 0.9 3\nSample Output 3:\n18.9029850746\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems. \n\nThe boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced.\n\nFormally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \\leq n, p \\leq 10^6)$.

For example, if the minimum difference is equal to $2$, but there is also a distribution where the difference is $10^9 + 8$, then the answer is $2$, not $1$.\n\nIn the first test case of the example, there're the following numbers: $4$, $8$, $16$, $16$, and $8$.

For example, a permutation $(2, 1, 3)$ has three distinct cyclic shifts: $(2, 1, 3)$, $(1, 3, 2)$, $(3, 2, 1)$.\n\nA subsequence of a subsegment of array $a$ from the $l$-th to the $r$-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$ for some $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ such that $l \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq r$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $q$ ($1 \\le n, m, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the permutation $p$, the length of the array $a$ and the number of queries.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers from $1$ to $n$, where the $i$-th of them is the $i$-th element of the permutation. Each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once.\n\nThe next line contains $m$ integers from $1$ to $n$, the $i$-th of them is the $i$-th element of the array $a$.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe queries. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$), meaning that the $i$-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the $l_i$-th to the $r_i$-th positions, inclusive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single string of length $q$, consisting of $0$ and $1$, the digit on the $i$-th positions should be $1$, if the subsegment of array $a$ from the $l_i$-th to the $r_i$-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of $p$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 6 3\n2 1 3\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n1 5\n2 6\n3 5\n\nOutput\n110\n\nInput\n2 4 3\n2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\n010\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the segment from the $1$-st to the $5$-th positions is $1, 2, 3, 1, 2$. There is a subsequence $1, 3, 2$ that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the $2$-nd to the $6$-th positions also contains a subsequence $2, 1, 3$ that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the $3$-rd to the $5$-th positions is $3, 1, 2$, there is only one subsequence of length $3$ ($3, 1, 2$), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.\n\nIn the second example the possible cyclic shifts are $1, 2$ and $2, 1$.

The cities are connected by one-way roads, the travel time for each of the road is a positive integer.\n\nOnce a year the President visited his historic home town t, for which his motorcade passes along some path from s to t (he always returns on a personal plane). Since the president is a very busy man, he always chooses the path from s to t, along which he will travel the fastest.\n\nThe ministry of Roads and Railways wants to learn for each of the road: whether the President will definitely pass through it during his travels, and if not, whether it is possible to repair it so that it would definitely be included in the shortest path from the capital to the historic home town of the President. Obviously, the road can not be repaired so that the travel time on it was less than one.

You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text.\n\nYour editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor, which points to the current character. Please note that it points to only one of the characters (and not between a pair of characters). Thus, it points to an index character. The user can move the cursor left or right one position. If the cursor is already at the first (leftmost) position, then it does not move left.\n\nInitially, the cursor is in the first (leftmost) character.\n\nAlso, the user can write a letter or brackets (either (, or )) to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at. A new character always overwrites the old value at that position.\n\nYour editor must check, whether the current line is the correct text. Text is correct if the brackets in them form the correct bracket sequence.\n\nFormally, correct text (CT) must satisfy the following rules:   any line without brackets is CT (the line can contain whitespaces);  If the first character of the string \u2014 is (, the last \u2014 is ), and all the rest form a CT, then the whole line is a CT;  two consecutively written CT is also CT. \n\nExamples of correct texts: hello(codeforces), round, ((i)(write))edi(tor)s, ( me). Examples of incorrect texts: hello)oops(, round), ((me).\n\nThe user uses special commands to work with your editor. Each command has its symbol, which must be written to execute this command.\n\nThe correspondence of commands and characters is as follows:   L \u2014 move the cursor one character to the left (remains in place if it already points to the first character);  R \u2014 move the cursor one character to the right;  any lowercase Latin letter or bracket (( or )) \u2014 write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now. \n\nFor a complete understanding, take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below.\n\nYou are given a string containing the characters that the user entered.

He has recently come up with a new algorithm, which receives a string as an input. Let's represent the input string of the algorithm as q = q_1q_2... q_{k}. The algorithm consists of two steps:\n\n  Find any continuous subsequence (substring) of three characters of string q, which doesn't equal to either string \"zyx\", \"xzy\", \"yxz\". If q doesn't contain any such subsequence, terminate the algorithm, otherwise go to step 2.  Rearrange the letters of the found subsequence randomly and go to step 1. \n\nSereja thinks that the algorithm works correctly on string q if there is a non-zero probability that the algorithm will be terminated. But if the algorithm anyway will work for infinitely long on a string, then we consider the algorithm to work incorrectly on this string.\n\nSereja wants to test his algorithm. For that, he has string s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, consisting of n characters. The boy conducts a series of m tests. As the i-th test, he sends substring s_{l}_{i}s_{l}_{i} + 1... s_{r}_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n) to the algorithm input. Unfortunately, the implementation of his algorithm works too long, so Sereja asked you to help. For each test (l_{i}, r_{i}) determine if the algorithm works correctly on this test or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains non-empty string s, its length (n) doesn't exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed that string s only contains characters: 'x', 'y', 'z'.\n\nThe second line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of tests. Next m lines contain the tests. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test, print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the algorithm works correctly on the corresponding test and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nzyxxxxxxyyz\n5\n5 5\n1 3\n1 11\n1 4\n3 6\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, in test one and two the algorithm will always be terminated in one step. In the fourth test you can get string \"xzyx\" on which the algorithm will terminate.

Recently the government decided to set up a nationwide fiber-optic network to take Siruseri into the digital age. And as usual, this decision was implemented in a capital centric manner --- from each city in the country, a fiber optic cable was laid to the capital! Thus, traffic between any two cities had to go through the capital.\nSoon, it became apparent that this was not quite a clever idea, since any breakdown at the capital resulted in the disconnection of services between other cities. So, in the second phase, the government plans to connect a few more pairs of cities directly by fiber-optic cables. The government has specified that this is to be done in such a way that the disruption of services at any one city will still leave the rest of the country connected.\nThe government has data on the cost of laying fiber optic cables between every pair of cities. You task is to compute the minimum cost of additional cabling required to ensure the requirement described above is met.\nFor example, if Siruseri has $4$ cities numbered $1,2,3$ and $4$ where $1$ is the capital and further suppose that the cost of laying cables between these cities are as given in the table below:\n\nNote that the government has already connected the capital with every other city. So, if we connect the cities $2$ and $3$ as well as $3$ and $4$, you can check that disruption of service at any one city will still leave the other cities connected. The cost of connecting these two pairs is $4 + 6 = 10$. The same effect could have been achieved by connecting $2$ and $3$ as well as $2$ and $4$, which would have cost $4 + 5 = 9$. You can check that this is the best you can do.\nYour task is to write a program that allows the government to determine the minimum cost it has to incur in laying additional cables to fulfil the requirement.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of cities in Siruseri. You may assume that the capital city is always numbered $1$. \n- This is followed by $N$ lines of input each containing $N$ integers. \n- The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i$ is the cost of connecting city $i$ with city $j$. The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i$ will be the same as the $i^{th}$ integer on line $j$ (since the links are bidirectional) and the $i^{th}$ entry on line $i$ will always be $0$ (there is no cost in connecting a city with itself).\n\n-----Output:-----\nA single integer indicating the minimum total cost of the links to be added to ensure that disruption of services at one city does not disconnect the rest of the cities.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2000$.\n- $0 \\leq$ costs given in the input $\\leq 100000$\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n0 7 8 10\n7 0 4 5 \n8 4 0 6\n10 5 6 0\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n9\n\nAnswer:\nn=int(input())\r\nl=[]\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n\tl.append([int(x) for x in input().split()])\r\nd=[10**9]*(n)\r\nq=set([int(x) for x in range(1,n)])\r\nd[1]=0\r\n#print(q)\r\ndef extract():\r\n\tmini=10**9\r\n\to=0\r\n\tfor i in range(1,len(d)):\r\n\t\tif d[i]<mini and i in q:\r\n\t\t\tmini=d[i]\r\n\t\t\to=i\r\n\tq.remove(o)\r\n\treturn o\r\nwhile len(q)!=0:\r\n\tx=extract()\r\n\tfor i in range(1,n):\r\n\t\tif i in q and l[x][i]<d[i]:\r\n\t\t\td[i]=l[x][i]\r\nprint(sum(d[1:]))\n\nQUESTION:\nOptimistan is a strange country. It is situated on an island with a huge desert in the middle, so most people live in port towns along the coast. As the name suggests, people of Optimistan (also called Optimists) like to optimise everything, so they only built roads necessary to connect all port towns together and not a single extra road. That means that there is only one way to get from one port town to another without visiting the same place twice.\n\nThe government installed multi-directional distance signs in $1$-kilometre intervals on one side of the road, to provide important information to drivers. Thus whenever you go from one port town to another, you pass the first sign at the port town and then one each kilometre. Every distance sign contains the shortest distances to all port towns, each written on a separate small sign directed towards the goal town.\n\nThe signs also serve another important function: to guide drivers on intersections. This means that distance of each intersection from every port town is an integer number of kilometres.\n\nYou bought a tourist guide of Optimistan which does not have a map of the country, but it contains a huge table with the shortest distances between all pairs of port towns. You quickly calculated the average shortest distance between all pairs of port towns, but then you started wondering: if the signs also contained shortest distances to all other signs, what would be the average number written on a sign? Could this be calculated just from the distance table in the tourist guide?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 500$), the number of ports;\n - $n-1$ lines, the $i$th of which contains $n-i$ integers.

It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\leq m \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq a < b \\leq 10^7$) \u2014 the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times. Each of the following lines contains three integers $u, v, c$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$, $u \\neq v$, $c \\in \\{a, b\\}$) denoting a single gravel road between the settlements $u$ and $v$, which requires $c$ minutes to travel.\n\nYou can assume that the road network is connected and has no loops or multiedges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line containing $n$ integers. The $p$-th of them should denote the minimum possible time required to travel from $1$ to $p$ after the selected roads are abandoned. Note that for each $p$ you can abandon a different set of roads.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5 20 25\n1 2 25\n2 3 25\n3 4 20\n4 5 20\n5 1 20\n\nOutput\n0 25 60 40 20\n\nInput\n6 7 13 22\n1 2 13\n2 3 13\n1 4 22\n3 4 13\n4 5 13\n5 6 13\n6 1 13\n\nOutput\n0 13 26 39 26 13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe minimum possible sum of times required to pass each road in the first example is $85$ \u2014 exactly one of the roads with passing time $25$ must be abandoned. Note that after one of these roads is abandoned, it's now impossible to travel between settlements $1$ and $3$ in time $50$.\n\nAnswer:\nimport heapq\nn,m,a,b=map(int,input().split())\ngraph={i:[] for i in range(n)}\nfor i in range(m):\n    u,v,w=map(int,input().split())\n    graph[u-1].append((v-1,w))\n    graph[v-1].append((u-1,w))\ncomponents=[-1]*n\ncomp=-1\nfor i in range(n):\n    if components[i]==-1:\n        comp+=1\n        components[i]=comp\n        prev=[]\n        layer=[i]\n        while layer!=[]:\n            newlayer=[]\n            for guy in layer:\n                for guy1 in graph[guy]:\n                    if guy1[1]==a and components[guy1[0]]==-1:\n                        newlayer.append(guy1[0])\n                        components[guy1[0]]=comp\n            prev=layer[:]\n            layer=newlayer[:]\nuseless=[]\nfor guy in graph:\n    for neigh in graph[guy]:\n        if components[guy]==components[neigh[0]] and neigh[1]==b:\n            useless.append((guy,neigh))\nfor guy in useless:\n    graph[guy[0]].remove(guy[1])\ncounts=[0]*(comp+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    counts[components[i]]+=1\nbad=[]\nfor i in range(comp+1):\n    if counts[i]<=3:\n        bad.append(i)\n        for j in range(n):\n            if components[j]==i:\n                components[j]=-1\nfor guy in bad[::-1]:\n    for i in range(n):\n        if components[i]>guy:\n            components[i]-=1\ncomp-=len(bad)\ncomp+=1\ndists=[[float(\"inf\") for i in range(2**comp)] for j in range(n)]\ndists[0][0]=0\npq=[]\nheapq.heappush(pq,[0,0,0])\nremaining=n\nvisited=[0]*n\nwhile len(pq)>0 and remaining>0:\n    dist,vert,mask=heapq.heappop(pq)\n    if visited[vert]==0:\n        visited[vert]=1\n        remaining-=1\n    for neigh in graph[vert]:\n        if neigh[1]==b:\n            if components[vert]==components[neigh[0]] and components[vert]!=-1:\n                continue\n            if components[neigh[0]]!=-1:\n                if mask & (2**components[neigh[0]])>0:\n                    continue\n            if components[vert]!=-1:\n                maskn=mask+2**(components[vert])\n            else:\n                maskn=mask\n        else:\n            maskn=mask\n        if dist+neigh[1]<dists[neigh[0]][maskn]:\n            dists[neigh[0]][maskn]=dist+neigh[1]\n            heapq.heappush(pq,[dist+neigh[1],neigh[0],maskn])\noptimal=[str(min(dists[i])) for i in range(n)]\nprint(\" \".join(optimal))\n\nQUESTION:\nYour state has just purchased a large, unspoiled tract of land, and wishes to turn it into a nature park with hiking trails.

She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy.\n\nBessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile $1$ (i.e. to maximize $a_1$), and she only has $d$ days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ if she acts optimally!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Next $2t$ lines contain a description of test cases \u00a0\u2014 two lines per test case.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n,d \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of haybale piles and the number of days, respectively. \n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 100$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of haybales in each pile.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ after $d$ days if Bessie acts optimally.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n4 5\n1 0 3 2\n2 2\n100 1\n1 8\n0\n\nOutput\n3\n101\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the sample, this is one possible way Bessie can end up with $3$ haybales in pile $1$:   On day one, move a haybale from pile $3$ to pile $2$  On day two, move a haybale from pile $3$ to pile $2$  On day three, move a haybale from pile $2$ to pile $1$  On day four, move a haybale from pile $2$ to pile $1$  On day five, do nothing  \n\nIn the second test case of the sample, Bessie can do nothing on the first day and move a haybale from pile $2$ to pile $1$ on the second day.\n\nAnswer:\n\nimport sys\n#sys.stdin=open(\"data.txt\")\ninput=sys.stdin.readline\nmii=lambda:list(map(int,input().split()))\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n,d=mii()\n    a=list(mii())\n    ans=0\n    for i in range(n):\n        while d>=i and a[i]:\n            a[i]-=1\n            ans+=1\n            d-=i\n    print(ans)\n\n\nQUESTION:\nBaxter Scott owns The Enlightened Dairy Co., a dairy company with magical cows. Early each morning, he brushes his teeth, strolls outside, and finds that the cows have doubled in number. With double the number of cows, he can produce double the quantity of milk. While he is ecstatic that he has so many cows and so much milk, the Dairy Regulator forces him to keep at most $C$ cows on any given farm, which greatly complicates his business.\n\nAt The Enlightened Dairy Co., Baxter has access to an unlimited number of farms, each with a maximum capacity of $C$ cows. On each farm, cows reproduce at the same rate: they always double in number when the clock strikes midnight. To stay within the Regulator\u2019s rules, whenever a farm has strictly more than $C$ cows, Baxter selects half of the cows on that farm and moves them to an entirely new, empty farm. More precisely, if there are $D \\leq C$ cows on a farm, he leaves all $D$ cows on the farm, but if there are $D > C$ cows on a farm, he leaves $\\left\\lceil \\frac{D}{2} \\right\\rceil $ cows on the farm and takes $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{D}{2} \\right\\rfloor $ cows to a new, empty farm. (Here $\\left\\lceil \\ \\right\\rceil $ and $\\left\\lfloor \\ \\right\\rfloor $ denote the ceiling and floor functions, which round up\/down to the nearest integer, respectively.) He does this early every morning, before the Regulator could possibly show up, so that he can avoid paying hefty Moo Fees.\n\nThe Regulator needs to know how many farms she will be inspecting when she visits The Enlightened Dairy Co. The Regulator inspects every farm that has at least one cow, and does not inspect any farm with zero cows. Given the number of cows on each farm with at least one cow on Day\u00a0$0$, compute the number of farms that need inspecting on any given day.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three space-separated integers, $C$, $N$, and $M$, where $C$ ($1 \\leq C \\leq 1000$) is the maximum number of cows allowed on a farm, $N$ ($0 \\leq N \\leq 1000$) is the number of farms with at least one cow on Day\u00a0$0$, and $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 50$) is the number of different days on which the Regulator visits. The following $N$ lines of input each have a single integer $c_ i$($1 \\leq c_ i \\leq C$), representing the number of cows on the $i$th of the $N$ farms on Day\u00a0$0$. The final $M$ lines each have a single integer $d_ j$ ($0 \\leq d_ j \\leq 50$), representing a day when the Regulator visits.

Jafar wants to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik.\nYalalovichik is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However, he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems on Timus. The deadline that Yalalovichik set before has passed and he refuses to send Jafar to the camp.\nJafar decided to make Yalalovichik happy in hopes of changing his decision, so he invented a new sequence of numbers and named them Yalalovichik numbers. Jafar is writing a research paper about their properties and wants to publish it in the Science Eagle yearly journal.\nA Yalalovichik number is created in the following way:\n- Consider an integer $N$ in decimal notation; let's call it the base of the Yalalovichik number $Y_N$. $N$ may not contain the digit $0$.\n- Treat $N$ as a decimal string. Compute all left shifts of this string $N_0, N_1, \\ldots, N_{|N|-1}$ ($|N|$ denotes the number of digits of $N$); specifically, $N_k$ denotes the string formed by moving the first $k$ digits of $N$ to the end in the same order.\n- Concatenate the strings $N_0, N_1, \\ldots, N_{|N|-1}$. The resulting string is the decimal notation of $Y_N$.\nFor example, if $N = 123$, the left shifts are $123, 231, 312$ and thus $Y_N = 123231312$.\nYou are given the base $N$. Calculate the value of $Y_N$ modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

For instance:\n```Perl\nsolve(1) = 4, because groups of 1 are [I, V, X, L]. \nsolve(2) = 10, because the groups of 2 are [II, VI, VV, XI, XV, XX, IL, VL, XL, LL] corresponding to [2,6,10,11,15,20,51,55,60,100]. \nsolve(3) = 20, because groups of 3 start with [III, IIV, IVV, ...etc]\n```\n\n`n <= 10E7`\n\nMore examples in test cases.

This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is positive.

Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. \n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible.

He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.\n\nAnswer:\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    a, b, c, d = (list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in 'abcd')\n    ss, tt, n2, res = [*b, *c[::-1]], [*a, *d[::-1]], n * 2, []\n    yx = [*[(2, i + 1) for i in range(n)], *[(3, i) for i in range(n, 0, -1)]]\n\n    def park():\n        for i, s, t, (y, x) in zip(range(n2), ss, tt, yx):\n            if s == t != 0:\n                ss[i] = 0\n                res.append(f'{s} {(1, 4)[y == 3]} {x}')\n\n    def rotate():\n        start = ss.index(0)\n        for i in range(start - n2, start - 1):\n            s = ss[i] = ss[i + 1]\n            if s:\n                y, x = yx[i]\n                res.append(f'{s} {y} {x}')\n        ss[start - 1] = 0\n\n    park()\n    if all(ss):\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    while any(ss):\n        rotate()\n        park()\n    print(len(res), '\\n'.join(res), sep='\\n')\n\n\ndef __starting_point():\n    main()\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nThe First Universal Bank of Denview has just been robbed! You want to catch the robbers before they leave the state.\n\nThe state of Calirado can be represented by a rectangular $n$-by-$m$ grid of characters, with the character in each grid cell denoting a terrain type. The robbers begin within the cell marked \u2018B\u2019, indicating the Bank of Denview. They will then travel across the state by moving from grid cell to grid cell in the four cardinal directions (left, right, up, down). (Note that the robbers pass only through grid edges, and not corners.) If the robbers manage to leave the state (by crossing any boundary edge of the grid) they will go into hiding, never to be seen again. You must stop this.\n\nTo catch the robbers, you can set up barricades. Barricades are placed inside a grid cell, and prevent the robbers from traveling into the cell (from any direction). Each grid square consists of a different type of terrain, with different cost for placing a barricade. You cannot place a barricade on the bank (\u2018B\u2019) or on any cell containing a dot (\u2018.\u2019), though the robbers can travel freely through these cells. Every other cell will contain a lowercase English letter, indicating a terrain type.\n\nFind the cheapest way to prevent the robbers from escaping Calirado.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $c$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 30$, $1 \\le c \\le 26$): the dimensions of the grid representing Calirado, and the number of different terrain types. Then follows $m$ lines of exactly $n$ characters each: the map of Calirado. Each character is either \u2018B\u2019, \u2018.\u2019, or one of the first $c$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Calirado is guaranteed to contain exactly one bank. After the grid, there is a line containing $c$ space-separated integers $1 \\leq c_ i \\leq 100000$, the costs of placing a barricade on a grid cell of each terrain type. $c_1$ is the cost for terrain type \u2018a\u2019, $c_2$ is the cost for \u2018b\u2019, and so forth.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer, the minimum total cost of the barricades that you need to place to prevent the robbers from escaping. If there is no way to prevent the robbers from escaping, print -1 instead.\n\nIn the first example, the minimum cost is to barricade the central three squares on each side of the bank for a total cost of $12$.\n\nIn the second example, since the bank is on the border, there is no way to prevent the robbers from escaping the state.\n\nIn the third example, we must prevent the robbers from leaving the bank to the top, bottom, and right, or else we cannot prevent them from leaving the state. To the left, however, it is cheaper to allow passage through the \u2018b\u2019 cell, and then barricade in each of the three directions from there.

However, in order not to lose face in front of the relatives, the King should first finish reforms in his kingdom. As the King can not wait for his daughter's marriage, reforms must be finished as soon as possible.\n\nThe kingdom currently consists of n cities. Cities are connected by n - 1 bidirectional road, such that one can get from any city to any other city. As the King had to save a lot, there is only one path between any two cities.\n\nWhat is the point of the reform? The key ministries of the state should be relocated to distinct cities (we call such cities important). However, due to the fact that there is a high risk of an attack by barbarians it must be done carefully. The King has made several plans, each of which is described by a set of important cities, and now wonders what is the best plan.\n\nBarbarians can capture some of the cities that are not important (the important ones will have enough protection for sure), after that the captured city becomes impassable. In particular, an interesting feature of the plan is the minimum number of cities that the barbarians need to capture in order to make all the important cities isolated, that is, from all important cities it would be impossible to reach any other important city.\n\nHelp the King to calculate this characteristic for each of his plan.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities in the kingdom.\n\nEach of the next n - 1 lines contains two distinct integers u_{i}, v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the indices of the cities connected by the i-th road.

And it is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output one integer, representing the minimum number of characters he has to replace to convert $s$ to any $k$-complete word.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n6 2\nabaaba\n6 3\nabaaba\n36 9\nhippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia\n21 7\nwudixiaoxingxingheclp\n\nOutput\n2\n0\n23\n16\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, one optimal solution is aaaaaa.\n\nIn the second test case, the given word itself is $k$-complete.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Unionfind:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.par = [-1]*n\n        self.rank = [1]*n\n    \n    def root(self, x):\n        r = x\n        \n        while not self.par[r]<0:\n            r = self.par[r]\n        \n        t = x\n        \n        while t!=r:\n            tmp = t\n            t = self.par[t]\n            self.par[tmp] = r\n        \n        return r\n    \n    def unite(self, x, y):\n        rx = self.root(x)\n        ry = self.root(y)\n        \n        if rx==ry:\n            return\n        \n        if self.rank[rx]<=self.rank[ry]:\n            self.par[ry] += self.par[rx]\n            self.par[rx] = ry\n            \n            if self.rank[rx]==self.rank[ry]:\n                self.rank[ry] += 1\n        else:\n            self.par[rx] += self.par[ry]\n            self.par[ry] = rx\n    \n    def is_same(self, x, y):\n        return self.root(x)==self.root(y)\n    \n    def count(self, x):\n        return -self.par[self.root(x)]\n\nt = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    s = input()[:-1]\n    uf = Unionfind(n)\n    \n    for i in range(n\/\/2):\n        uf.unite(i, n-1-i)\n    \n    for i in range(n-k):\n        uf.unite(i, i+k)\n    \n    d = defaultdict(dict)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] not in d[uf.root(i)]:\n            d[uf.root(i)][s[i]] = 1\n        else:\n            d[uf.root(i)][s[i]] += 1\n    \n    rs = set(uf.root(i) for i in range(n))\n    ans = 0\n    \n    for r in rs:\n        ans += uf.count(r)-max(list(d[r].values()))\n    \n    print(ans)\n\nQUESTION:\nPolycarp loves ciphers.

In this version Ujan makes at most $2n$ swaps. In addition, $k \\le 1000, n \\le 50$ and it is necessary to print swaps themselves. You can hack this problem if you solve it. But you can hack the previous problem only if you solve both problems.\n\nAfter struggling and failing many times, Ujan decided to try to clean up his house again. He decided to get his strings in order first.\n\nUjan has two distinct strings $s$ and $t$ of length $n$ consisting of only of lowercase English characters. He wants to make them equal. Since Ujan is lazy, he will perform the following operation at most $2n$ times: he takes two positions $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i,j \\le n$, the values $i$ and $j$ can be equal or different), and swaps the characters $s_i$ and $t_j$.\n\nUjan's goal is to make the strings $s$ and $t$ equal. He does not need to minimize the number of performed operations: any sequence of operations of length $2n$ or shorter is suitable.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 1000$), the number of test cases.\n\nFor each of the test cases, the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 50$), the length of the strings $s$ and $t$. \n\nEach of the next two lines contains the strings $s$ and $t$, each having length exactly $n$. The strings consist only of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that strings are different.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if Ujan can make the two strings equal with at most $2n$ operations and \"No\" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\nIn the case of \"Yes\" print $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 2n$) on the next line, where $m$ is the number of swap operations to make the strings equal. Then print $m$ lines, each line should contain two integers $i, j$ ($1 \\le i, j \\le n$) meaning that Ujan swaps $s_i$ and $t_j$ during the corresponding operation. You do not need to minimize the number of operations. Any sequence of length not more than $2n$ is suitable.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\nsouse\nhouhe\n3\ncat\ndog\n2\naa\naz\n3\nabc\nbca\n\nOutput\nYes\n1\n1 4\nNo\nNo\nYes\n3\n1 2\n3 1\n2 3\n\nAnswer:\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input()\n    t = input()\n\n    d = {}\n    for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        d[chr(i)] = 0\n\n    for cs in s:\n        d[cs] += 1\n    for ct in t:\n        d[ct] += 1\n\n    ok = True\n    for e in d:\n        if d[e] % 2 == 1:\n            ok = False\n\n    if not ok:\n        print(\"No\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n        changes = []\n\n        s, t = list(s), list(t)\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            if s[i] != t[i]:\n                r = (0, -1)\n                for j in range(i+1, n):\n                    if s[j] == t[i]:\n                        r = (j, 0)\n\n                for j in range(i+1, n):\n                    if t[j] == t[i]:\n                        r = (j, 1)\n\n                if r[1] == 0:\n                    changes += [(r[0], i+1), (i, i+1)]\n                    s[r[0]], t[i+1] = t[i+1], s[r[0]]\n                    s[i], t[i+1] = t[i+1], s[i]\n                elif r[1] == 1:\n                    changes += [(i, r[0])]\n                    s[i], t[r[0]] = t[r[0]], s[i]\n\n        print(len(changes))\n        for change in changes:\n            x, y = change\n            print(x+1, y+1)\n\nQUESTION:\n\u017dofka invented a new word puzzle.

Now it's time to clean up and Misha needs to put them in a basket. He ordered this task to his pet robot that agreed to complete the task at certain conditions. Before the robot puts a number x to the basket, Misha should answer the question: is it possible to choose one or multiple numbers that already are in the basket, such that their XOR sum equals x? \n\nIf the answer is positive, you also need to give the indexes of these numbers. If there are multiple options of choosing numbers, you are allowed to choose any correct option. After Misha's answer the robot puts the number to the basket.\n\nInitially the basket is empty. Each integer you put in the basket takes some number. The first integer you put into the basket take number 0, the second integer takes number 1 and so on.\n\nMisha needs to clean up the place as soon as possible but unfortunately, he isn't that good at mathematics. He asks you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains number m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000), showing how many numbers are scattered around the room.\n\nThe next m lines contain the numbers in the order in which the robot puts them in the basket. Each number is a positive integer strictly less than 10^600 that doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each number either print a 0 on the corresponding line, if the number cannot be represented as a XOR sum of numbers that are in the basket, or print integer k showing how many numbers are in the representation and the indexes of these numbers. Separate the numbers by spaces. Each number can occur in the representation at most once.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n0\n0\n3 0 1 2\n2 1 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 1\n\nInput\n2\n5\n5\n\nOutput\n0\n1 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe XOR sum of numbers is the result of bitwise sum of numbers modulo 2.\n\nAnswer:\nbuck = [[0, 0] for i in range(2201)]\nm = int(input())\nfor i in range(m):\n    a = int(input())\n    ok = True\n    br = 0\n    for j in range(2200, -1, -1):\n        if a & (1 << j):\n            if(buck[j][0]):\n                a  ^= buck[j][0]\n                br ^= buck[j][1]\n            else:\n                ok = False\n                buck[j][0] = a\n                buck[j][1] = br | (1 << i)\n                break\n    if not ok:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        lst = []\n        for j in range(2201):\n            if br & (1 << j):\n                lst.append(j)\n        print(len(lst), end = ' ')\n        for j in lst:\n            print(j, end = ' ')\n        print('\\n', end='')\n\n\nQUESTION:\nSergei B., the young coach of Pokemons, has found the big house which consists of n flats ordered in a row from left to right.

Her brother Nikhil has played a rather nasty prank. He has glued together pairs of tiles with 0 written on them. Lavanya now has square tiles with 1 on them and rectangular tiles with two 0's on them, made up of two square tiles with 0 stuck together). Thus, she can no longer make all possible binary sequences using these tiles.\nTo amuse herself, Lavanya has decided to pick a number $N$ and try and construct as many binary sequences of length $N$ as possible using her collection of tiles. For example if $N$ = 1, she can only make the sequence 1. For $N$=2, she can make 11 and 00. For $N$=4, there are 5 possibilities: 0011, 0000, 1001, 1100 and 1111.\nLavanya would like you to write a program to compute the number of arrangements possible with $N$ tiles so that she can verify that she has generated all of them. Since she cannot count beyond 15746, it is sufficient to report this number modulo 15746.\n\n-----Input:-----\nA single line with a single integer $N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nA single integer indicating the number of binary sequences of length $N$, modulo 15746, that Lavanya can make using her tiles.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\nYou may assume that $N \\leq$ 1000000.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n5\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nThis corresponds to the example discussed above.\n\nAnswer:\nn=int(input())\nmodulo=15746\nnum=[1,1]\nfor i in range(2,n+1):\n    num.append((num[i-1]+num[i-2])%modulo)\nprint(num[n])\n\nQUESTION:\nOne nice summer day while Mirko was drinking lemonade in his room...\n\n\u201cBig brother!\u201d, yells Stanko.\n\n\u201cI wonder sometimes which of the two of us is the big one.

RedDreamer has to paint each element of $a$ into one of two colors, white and black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then create two arrays $c$ and $d$ so that all white elements belong to $c$, and all black elements belong to $d$ (it is possible that one of these two arrays becomes empty). RedDreamer wants to paint the elements in such a way that $f(c) + f(d)$ is minimum possible.\n\nFor example:\n\n  if $n = 6$, $T = 7$ and $a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$, it is possible to paint the $1$-st, the $4$-th and the $5$-th elements white, and all other elements black. So $c = [1, 4, 5]$, $d = [2, 3, 6]$, and $f(c) + f(d) = 0 + 0 = 0$;  if $n = 3$, $T = 6$ and $a = [3, 3, 3]$, it is possible to paint the $1$-st element white, and all other elements black. So $c = [3]$, $d = [3, 3]$, and $f(c) + f(d) = 0 + 1 = 1$. \n\nHelp RedDreamer to paint the array optimally!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$.\n\nThere is a hidden permutation of length $n$.\n\nFor each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element.\n\nYour task is to restore the permutation.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $s_{1}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{n}$ ($0 \\le s_{i} \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the array $s$ corresponds to a valid permutation of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n$ integers $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{n}$ \u2014 the elements of the restored permutation.

For $i = 5$ all $j = 1, 2, 3, 4$ are possible, so $s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10$.\n\nAnswer:\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\n\nn=int(input())\nA=list(map(int,input().split()))\n\nBIT=[0]*(n+1)\n\ndef update(v,w):\n    while v<=n:\n        BIT[v]+=w\n        v+=(v&(-v))\n\ndef getvalue(v):\n    ANS=0\n    while v!=0:\n        ANS+=BIT[v]\n        v-=(v&(-v))\n    return ANS\n\nfor i in range(1,n+1):\n    update(i,i)\n\nANS=[-1]*n\n\nfor i in range(n-1,-1,-1):\n    MIN=0\n    MAX=n\n    k=A[i]\n\n    while True:\n        x=(MIN+MAX+1)\/\/2\n\n\n        if getvalue(x)>k:\n            if getvalue(x-1)==k:\n                ANS[i]=x\n                break\n            else:\n                MAX=x\n        else:\n            MIN=x\n\n    update(x,-x)\n\n            \nprint(*ANS)\n\n\nQUESTION:\nA permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order.

Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nThe median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence $A = [1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11]$, the median is equal to $4$, and for $A = [2, 3, 4, 5]$, the median is equal to $(3+4)\/2 = 3.5$.\nFulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence $A$ with length $N$:\nread(N)\nread(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])\nsort(A)\n# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A\n# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged\nremove(A[K], A[N mod K])\nreturn A[(N-2)\/2] # integer division\n\nThe program takes an integer $K$ as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive.\nLittle Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence $A = [34, 23, 35, 514]$, which is a counterexample for any $K \\le 3$), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters $S, K, m, M$ (in addition to $N$) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest proper sequence $A$ with length $N$ as a counterexample.\nWe say that a sequence $A$ with length $N$ ($0$-indexed) is proper if it satisfies the following conditions:\n- it contains only positive integers\n- $A_0 + A_1 +A_2 + \\dots + A_{N-1} = S$\n- $m \\le A_i \\le M$ for each $0 \\le i < N$\n- the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter $K$, is different from the correct median of the sequence $A$\nCan you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers \u2014 the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 8$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N-1$\n- $1 \\le S \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le m \\le M \\le S$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n3 6 1 1 5\n4 4 2 1 3\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1 1 4\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: For the sequence $A = [1, 1, 4]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements ($K=1$, $N\\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.\nExample case 2: The only possible sequence is $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer $1$ for it.\n\nAnswer:\n# cook your dish here\n# cook your dish here\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef findSeq(n, s, k, m, M):\n    midInd = n \/\/ 2\n    seqs = []\n    for ind in range(midInd + 2, midInd - 3, -1):\n        if ind >= n or ind < 0:\n            continue     \n        seq = genBestSeq(n, ind, m, M, s)\n        if seq is not -1 and testSeq(k, seq):\n            seqs.append(list(seq))\n    if len(seqs) == 0:\n        return -1\n    return min(seqs)\n\n#def findSeq(n, s, k, m, M):\n#    midInd = n \/\/ 2\n#    if k <= midInd: #and (n % 2 == 1 or s < m * midInd + M * (n - midInd)):\n#        return genBestSeq(n, midInd + 1, m, M, s) \n#    elif k > midInd + 1 and n % 2 == 1:\n#        return -1\n#    return genBestSeq(n, midInd, m, M, s)\n\ndef genBestSeq(n, diffInd, m, M, s):\n    #inc = M - m - 1\n    arr = np.full((n,), m)\n    arr[diffInd:] += 1\n    #remainder = s - np.sum(arr)\n    #if remainder < 0:\n    #    return -1\n\n    #nFull, remainder = divmod(remainder, inc)\n    #if nFull > n or (nFull == n and remainder > 0):\n    #    return -1\n\n    #addingInd = n - nFull -1\n    #arr[addingInd + 1:] += inc\n    #arr[addingInd] += remainder\n    #return arr\n    s = s - np.sum(arr)\n    if s < 0:\n        return -1\n    inc = M - m - 1\n    ind = n - 1\n    while (ind >= 0):\n        z = min(inc, s)\n        arr[ind] += z\n        s -= z\n        ind -= 1\n    if s != 0:\n        return -1\n    return arr\n\ndef testSeq(k, seq):\n    seq = sorted(seq)\n    n = len(seq)\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        median = seq[n \/\/ 2]\n    else:\n        median = (seq[n \/\/ 2 - 1] + seq[n \/\/ 2]) \/ 2\n    seq.pop(n % k)\n    seq.pop(k - 1)\n    return (median != seq[(n - 2) \/\/ 2]) \n    \n\ndef __starting_point():\n    nCases = int(input())\n    answers = []\n    #ks = []\n    for i in range(nCases):\n        #nums = [int(val) for val in input().split()]\n        #ks.append(nums[2])\n        #answers.append(findSeq(*nums))\n        answers.append(findSeq(*(int(val) for val in input().split())))\n        ans = answers[-1]\n        if not isinstance(ans, int):\n            print(*ans, sep=' ')\n        else:\n            print(ans)\n    #for i, ans in enumerate(answers):\n\n    #for ans in answers:\n    #    if isinstance(ans, np.ndarray):\n    #        print(*ans, sep=' ')\n    #    else:\n    #        print(ans)\n\n__starting_point()\n\nQUESTION:\nA smallest different sequence (SDS) is a sequence of positive integers created as follows: $A_1=r \\geq 1$.

Long a ago when the modern entertainment systems did not exist people used to go to watch plays in theaters, where people would perform live in front of an audience. There was a beautiful actress who had a disability she could not pronounce the character $'r'$. To win her favours which many have been denied in past, you decide to write a whole play without the character $'r'$. Now you have to get the script reviewed by the editor before presenting it to her.\nThe editor was flattered by the script and agreed to you to proceed. The editor will edit the script in this way to suit her style. For each word replace it with a sub-sequence of itself such that it contains the character 'a'. \nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements Wikipedia \nNow given a script with $N$ words, for each word in the script you wish to know the number of subsequences with which it can be replaced. \n\n-----Input:-----\n- First-line will contain $N$, the number of words in the script. Then next $N$ line with one test case each. \n- Each test case contains a single word $W_i$\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line number of subsequences with which it can be replaced. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq$ length of $W_i$  $\\leq 20$\n- $W_i$  on contains lowercase english alphabets and does not have the character 'r'\n\n-----Sample Input 1:-----\n2\nabc\naba\n\n-----Sample Output 1:-----\n4\n6\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nThis subsequences with which $abc$ can be replaed : ${a,ab,ac,abc}$. \nThis subsequences with which $aba$ can be replaed : ${a,ab,aba,a,ba,a}$. \n\n-----Sample Input 2:-----\n3\nabcde\nabcdea\nxyz\n\n-----Sample Output 2:-----\n16\n48\n0\n\nAnswer:\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    S = input()\r\n    n = len(S)\r\n    a = n - S.count('a')\r\n    print(2 ** n - 2 ** a)\n\nQUESTION:\nIt is now far into the future and human civilization is ancient history.

They want to classify each word in the dictionary as either correct or a typo. Na\u00efvely, they do this using a simple rule: a typo is any word in the dictionary such that deleting a single character from that word produces another word in the dictionary.\n\nHelp these alien archaeologists out!

The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nAnswer:\nq = int(input())\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    info = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\n    info = sorted(info)\n    now =(m, m)\n    time = 0\n    flag = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        t, l, h = info[i]\n        l_now = now[0] - (t - time)\n        h_now = now[1] + (t - time)\n        time = t\n        if h < l_now or h_now < l:\n            flag = False\n        else:\n            l_now = max(l_now, l)\n            h_now = min(h_now, h)\n            now = (l_now, h_now)\n    if flag:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nQUESTION:\nTo stay woke and attentive during classes, Karen needs some coffee!

It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was.

But, he doesn't want to tell Tolik about his inability to solve it, so he hasn't found anything better than asking you how to solve this task.\n\nIn this task you are given a cell field $n \\cdot m$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, where point's coordinates $(x, y)$ mean it is situated in the $x$-th row and $y$-th column, considering numeration from one ($1 \\leq x \\leq n, 1 \\leq y \\leq m$). Initially, you stand in the cell $(1, 1)$. Every move you can jump from cell $(x, y)$, which you stand in, by any non-zero vector $(dx, dy)$, thus you will stand in the $(x+dx, y+dy)$ cell. Obviously, you can't leave the field, but also there is one more important condition\u00a0\u2014 you're not allowed to use one vector twice. Your task is to visit each cell of the field exactly once (the initial cell is considered as already visited).\n\nTolik's uncle is a very respectful person.

He travels around the world, tasting new delights of famous chefs from the most fashionable restaurants. Mr. Apple has his own signature method of review \u00a0\u2014 in each restaurant Mr. Apple orders two sets of dishes on two different days. All the dishes are different, because Mr. Apple doesn't like to eat the same food. For each pair of dishes from different days he remembers exactly which was better, or that they were of the same quality. After this the gourmet evaluates each dish with a positive integer.\n\nOnce, during a revision of a restaurant of Celtic medieval cuisine named \u00abPoisson\u00bb, that serves chestnut soup with fir, warm soda bread, spicy lemon pie and other folk food, Mr. Apple was very pleasantly surprised the gourmet with its variety of menu, and hence ordered too much. Now he's confused about evaluating dishes.\n\nThe gourmet tasted a set of $n$ dishes on the first day and a set of $m$ dishes on the second day. He made a table $a$ of size $n \\times m$, in which he described his impressions. If, according to the expert, dish $i$ from the first set was better than dish $j$ from the second set, then $a_{ij}$ is equal to \">\", in the opposite case $a_{ij}$ is equal to \"<\". Dishes also may be equally good, in this case $a_{ij}$ is \"=\".\n\nNow Mr. Apple wants you to help him to evaluate every dish. Since Mr. Apple is very strict, he will evaluate the dishes so that the maximal number used is as small as possible. But Mr. Apple also is very fair, so he never evaluates the dishes so that it goes against his feelings. In other words, if $a_{ij}$ is \"<\", then the number assigned to dish $i$ from the first set should be less than the number of dish $j$ from the second set, if $a_{ij}$ is \">\", then it should be greater, and finally if $a_{ij}$ is \"=\", then the numbers should be the same.\n\nHelp Mr. Apple to evaluate each dish from both sets so that it is consistent with his feelings, or determine that this is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of dishes in both days.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains a string of $m$ symbols. The $j$-th symbol on $i$-th line is $a_{ij}$. All strings consist only of \"<\", \">\" and \"=\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of output should contain \"Yes\", if it's possible to do a correct evaluation for all the dishes, or \"No\" otherwise.\n\nIf case an answer exist, on the second line print $n$ integers\u00a0\u2014 evaluations of dishes from the first set, and on the third line print $m$ integers\u00a0\u2014 evaluations of dishes from the second set.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n>>>>\n>>>>\n>>>>\n\nOutput\nYes\n2 2 2 \n1 1 1 1 \n\nInput\n3 3\n>>>\n<<<\n>>>\n\nOutput\nYes\n3 1 3 \n2 2 2 \n\nInput\n3 2\n==\n=<\n==\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, all dishes of the first day are better than dishes of the second day. So, the highest score will be $2$, for all dishes of the first day.\n\nIn the third sample, the table is contradictory\u00a0\u2014 there is no possible evaluation of the dishes that satisfies it.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

After this the gourmet evaluates each dish with a positive integer.\n\nOnce, during a revision of a restaurant of Celtic medieval cuisine named \u00abPoisson\u00bb, that serves chestnut soup with fir, warm soda bread, spicy lemon pie and other folk food, Mr. Apple was very pleasantly surprised the gourmet with its variety of menu, and hence ordered too much. Now he's confused about evaluating dishes.\n\nThe gourmet tasted a set of $n$ dishes on the first day and a set of $m$ dishes on the second day. He made a table $a$ of size $n \\times m$, in which he described his impressions. If, according to the expert, dish $i$ from the first set was better than dish $j$ from the second set, then $a_{ij}$ is equal to \">\", in the opposite case $a_{ij}$ is equal to \"<\". Dishes also may be equally good, in this case $a_{ij}$ is \"=\".\n\nNow Mr. Apple wants you to help him to evaluate every dish. Since Mr. Apple is very strict, he will evaluate the dishes so that the maximal number used is as small as possible. But Mr. Apple also is very fair, so he never evaluates the dishes so that it goes against his feelings. In other words, if $a_{ij}$ is \"<\", then the number assigned to dish $i$ from the first set should be less than the number of dish $j$ from the second set, if $a_{ij}$ is \">\", then it should be greater, and finally if $a_{ij}$ is \"=\", then the numbers should be the same.\n\nHelp Mr. Apple to evaluate each dish from both sets so that it is consistent with his feelings, or determine that this is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of dishes in both days.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains a string of $m$ symbols. The $j$-th symbol on $i$-th line is $a_{ij}$. All strings consist only of \"<\", \">\" and \"=\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of output should contain \"Yes\", if it's possible to do a correct evaluation for all the dishes, or \"No\" otherwise.\n\nIf case an answer exist, on the second line print $n$ integers\u00a0\u2014 evaluations of dishes from the first set, and on the third line print $m$ integers\u00a0\u2014 evaluations of dishes from the second set.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n>>>>\n>>>>\n>>>>\n\nOutput\nYes\n2 2 2 \n1 1 1 1 \n\nInput\n3 3\n>>>\n<<<\n>>>\n\nOutput\nYes\n3 1 3 \n2 2 2 \n\nInput\n3 2\n==\n=<\n==\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, all dishes of the first day are better than dishes of the second day. So, the highest score will be $2$, for all dishes of the first day.\n\nIn the third sample, the table is contradictory\u00a0\u2014 there is no possible evaluation of the dishes that satisfies it.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

One day they decided to join a logging factory in order to make money. \n\nThe manager of logging factory wants them to go to the jungle and cut n trees with heights a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. They bought a chain saw from a shop. Each time they use the chain saw on the tree number i, they can decrease the height of this tree by one unit. Each time that Kalila and Dimna use the chain saw, they need to recharge it. Cost of charging depends on the id of the trees which have been cut completely (a tree is cut completely if its height equal to 0). If the maximum id of a tree which has been cut completely is i (the tree that have height a_{i} in the beginning), then the cost of charging the chain saw would be b_{i}. If no tree is cut completely, Kalila and Dimna cannot charge the chain saw. The chainsaw is charged in the beginning. We know that for each i < j, a_{i} < a_{j} and b_{i} > b_{j} and also b_{n} = 0 and a_1 = 1. Kalila and Dimna want to cut all the trees completely, with minimum cost. \n\nThey want you to help them!

You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 20).\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers a_{i} follow in the strictly increasing order.\n\nThe next line contains integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 20) \u2014 the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.\n\nThe next q lines contain numbers x_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 2\u00b710^8) \u2014 the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 20\n10 50 100 500 1000 5000\n8\n4200\n100000\n95000\n96000\n99000\n10100\n2015\n9950\n\nOutput\n6\n20\n19\n20\n-1\n3\n-1\n-1\n\nInput\n5 2\n1 2 3 5 8\n8\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n-1\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

It looks like a claw:\n\n [Image] The center of the claw is the vertex with label $1$. \n\nLee has a Rooted Dead Bush of level $n$. Initially, all vertices of his RDB are green.\n\nIn one move, he can choose a claw in his RDB, if all vertices in the claw are green and all vertices of the claw are children of its center, then he colors the claw's vertices in yellow.\n\nHe'd like to know the maximum number of yellow vertices he can achieve. Since the answer might be very large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nNext $t$ lines contain test cases\u00a0\u2014 one per line.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the level of Lee's RDB.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of yellow vertices Lee can make modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n100\n2000000\n\nOutput\n0\n0\n4\n4\n12\n990998587\n804665184\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIt's easy to see that the answer for RDB of level $1$ or $2$ is $0$.\n\nThe answer for RDB of level $3$ is $4$ since there is only one claw we can choose: $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe answer for RDB of level $4$ is $4$ since we can choose either single claw $\\{1, 3, 2, 4\\}$ or single claw $\\{2, 7, 5, 6\\}$. There are no other claws in the RDB of level $4$ (for example, we can't choose $\\{2, 1, 7, 6\\}$, since $1$ is not a child of center vertex $2$).\n\n $\\therefore$ Rooted Dead Bush of level 4.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}

They are lined up in a row. The information about how exactly they are lined up it is provided to you by a string of length n. If the i-th character of this string is 's', then it means that there is a snake at the i-th position, whereas the character 'm' denotes a mongoose.\nYou might have heard about the age-old rivalry between hares and tortoises, but in Snakeland, the rivalry between snakes and mongooses is much more famous. The snakes and the mongooses want to hold a final poll in which the ultimate winner of this age-old battle will be decided. If the snakes get more votes than the mongooses, they will be the ultimate winners. Similarly, if the mongooses get more votes than snakes, they will be the ultimate winners. Obviously, each animal is loyal to their species, i.e. each snake will vote for the snakes to be the ultimate champions and each mongoose for the mongooses.\n\nTomorrow's the election day. Before the elections, the mongooses decided to cheat. They planned that each mongoose will eat at most one of its neighbor snakes. Two animals are said to be neighbors of each other if they are consecutive to each other in the row. After this, the elections will be held. The mongooses planned in such a way that the number of snakes eaten is maximized. Can you find out who will win the final poll? Output \"snakes\", \"mongooses\" or \"tie\" correspondingly.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains a string consisting of characters 's' and 'm'. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case output a single line containing \"snakes\", \"mongooses\" or \"tie\" correspondingly (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\nsm\nssm\nsms\nssmmmssss\n\nOutput\nmongooses\ntie\ntie\nsnakes\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample 1. The mongoose will eat the snake. Only the mongoose will be left. So, on the election day, there is one mongoose and zero snakes. So mongooses will win.\nExample 2. The mongoose will eat the snake at position 2 (1-based indexing). One mongoose and one snake will be left. Hence, there will be a tie.\nExample 3. The mongoose can eat either the snake to its left or to the right. But, it can eat only one of them. Afterwards, there will be a single snake and mongoose. So, it will result in a tie. \nExample 4. The mongooses can eat at max two snakes. For example, s*mmm*sss, where * denotes the snakes that were eaten by mongooses. After this, we have four snakes and three mongooses.

Also, there are three mandatory conditions the design should fulfill.\nThe first requirement is that any computer in the network should be able to communicate with any other computer through the connections, possibly, through some other computers.\nNetwork attacks are possible, so the second requirement is that even if any one computer from the network gets disabled so that the rest of the computers are unable to communicate with it, the rest of the computers can still communicate with each other. In other words, the first requirement still holds for any subset of (N-1) computers.\nThe third requirement is that there shouldn't be any irrelevant connections in the network. We will call a connection irrelevant if and only if after its' removal, the above two requirements are still held.\nGiven N, M, please build a network with N computers and M connections, or state that it is impossible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a pair of space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of computers and the number of connections.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput T blocks.\nIf it is impossible to construct a network with the given parameters for the corresponding test case, output just -1 -1. Otherwise, output M lines, each of which contains a space-separated pairs of integers denoting the IDs of the computers that should be connected. Note that multiple connections between any pair of computers and connections connecting a computer to itself are implicitly not allowed due to the third requirement.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n- 1 \u2264 M \u2264 N * (N - 1) \/ 2\n- 1 \u2264 Sum of all N \u2264 1000\n- Subtask 1 (21 point): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 4\n- Subtask 2 (79 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:2\n10 1\n5 5\n\nOutput:-1 -1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.

These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!).\n\nMain feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers.\n\nFor each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as c_{i}, 1 and c_{i}, 2.\n\nIn order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day.\n\nData center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data center computers are installing software updates, and thus they may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly h hours long. For each data center there is an integer u_{j} (0 \u2264 u_{j} \u2264 h - 1) defining the index of an hour of day, such that during this hour data center j is unavailable due to maintenance.\n\nSumming up everything above, the condition u_{c}_{i}, 1 \u2260 u_{c}_{i}, 2 should hold for each client, or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that store it are under maintenance.\n\nDue to occasional timezone change in different cities all over the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if u_{j} = h - 1, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become u_{j} + 1). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.\n\nSuch an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers n, m and h (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100 000, 2 \u2264 h \u2264 100 000), the number of company data centers, number of clients and the day length of day measured in hours. \n\nThe second line of input contains n integers u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n} (0 \u2264 u_{j} < h), j-th of these numbers is an index of a maintenance hour for data center j. \n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers c_{i}, 1 and c_{i}, 2 (1 \u2264 c_{i}, 1, c_{i}, 2 \u2264 n, c_{i}, 1 \u2260 c_{i}, 2), defining the data center indices containing the data of client i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given maintenance schedule allows each client to access at least one copy of his data at any moment of day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum possible number of data centers k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data available for any client.\n\nIn the second line print k distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 n), the indices of data centers whose maintenance time will be shifted by one hour later. Data center indices may be printed in any order.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, it is allowed to print any of them.

The given answer is the only way to conduct an experiment involving the only data center. In such a scenario the third data center has a maintenance during the hour 1, and no two data centers storing the information of the same client have maintenance at the same hour.\n\nOn the other hand, for example, if we shift the maintenance time on hour later for the first data center, then the data of clients 1 and 3 will be unavailable during the hour 0.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

His modification of a hard drive has not one, but n different heads that can read data in parallel.\n\nWhen viewed from the side, Mike's hard drive is an endless array of tracks. The tracks of the array are numbered from left to right with integers, starting with 1. In the initial state the i-th reading head is above the track number h_{i}. For each of the reading heads, the hard drive's firmware can move the head exactly one track to the right or to the left, or leave it on the current track. During the operation each head's movement does not affect the movement of the other heads: the heads can change their relative order; there can be multiple reading heads above any of the tracks. A track is considered read if at least one head has visited this track. In particular, all of the tracks numbered h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} have been read at the beginning of the operation. [Image] \n\nMike needs to read the data on m distinct tracks with numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m}. Determine the minimum time the hard drive firmware needs to move the heads and read all the given tracks. Note that an arbitrary number of other tracks can also be read.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of disk heads and the number of tracks to read, accordingly. The second line contains n distinct integers h_{i} in ascending order (1 \u2264 h_{i} \u2264 10^10, h_{i} < h_{i} + 1) \u2014 the initial positions of the heads. The third line contains m distinct integers p_{i} in ascending order (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 10^10, p_{i} < p_{i} + 1) - the numbers of tracks to read.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

The street begins from the main square and looks like a very long segment. There are n bus stops located along the street, the i-th of them is located at the distance a_{i} from the central square, all distances are distinct, the stops are numbered in the order of increasing distance from the square, that is, a_{i} < a_{i} + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1. The bus starts its journey from the first stop, it passes stops 2, 3 and so on. It reaches the stop number n, turns around and goes in the opposite direction to stop 1, passing all the intermediate stops in the reverse order. After that, it again starts to move towards stop n. During the day, the bus runs non-stop on this route.\n\nThe bus is equipped with the Berland local positioning system. When the bus passes a stop, the system notes down its number.\n\nOne of the key features of the system is that it can respond to the queries about the distance covered by the bus for the parts of its path between some pair of stops. A special module of the system takes the input with the information about a set of stops on a segment of the path, a stop number occurs in the set as many times as the bus drove past it. This module returns the length of the traveled segment of the path (or -1 if it is impossible to determine the length uniquely). The operation of the module is complicated by the fact that stop numbers occur in the request not in the order they were visited but in the non-decreasing order.\n\nFor example, if the number of stops is 6, and the part of the bus path starts at the bus stop number 5, ends at the stop number 3 and passes the stops as follows: $5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 3$, then the request about this segment of the path will have form: 3, 4, 5, 5, 6.

Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5)$), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight $1$ in the graph. \n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$, $a_i \\neq b_i$), the endpoints of the $i$-th edge of weight $1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 11\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n1 6\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight $0$, other edges have weight $1$. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight $2$.

You may consult the following example coding questions and their answers to provide the code. Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nZS the Coder loves mazes. Your job is to create one so that he can play with it. A maze consists of n \u00d7 m rooms, and the rooms are arranged in n rows (numbered from the top to the bottom starting from 1) and m columns (numbered from the left to the right starting from 1). The room in the i-th row and j-th column is denoted by (i, j). A player starts in the room (1, 1) and wants to reach the room (n, m).\n\nEach room has four doors (except for ones at the maze border), one on each of its walls, and two adjacent by the wall rooms shares the same door. Some of the doors are locked, which means it is impossible to pass through the door. For example, if the door connecting (i, j) and (i, j + 1) is locked, then we can't go from (i, j) to (i, j + 1). Also, one can only travel between the rooms downwards (from the room (i, j) to the room (i + 1, j)) or rightwards (from the room (i, j) to the room (i, j + 1)) provided the corresponding door is not locked. [Image] This image represents a maze with some doors locked. The colored arrows denotes all the possible paths while a red cross denotes a locked door. \n\nZS the Coder considers a maze to have difficulty x if there is exactly x ways of travelling from the room (1, 1) to the room (n, m). Two ways are considered different if they differ by the sequence of rooms visited while travelling.\n\nYour task is to create a maze such that its difficulty is exactly equal to T. In addition, ZS the Coder doesn't like large mazes, so the size of the maze and the number of locked doors are limited. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of the input contains a single integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^18), the difficulty of the required maze.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line should contain two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the maze respectively.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 300)\u00a0\u2014 the number of locked doors in the maze.\n\nThen, k lines describing locked doors should follow. Each of them should contain four integers, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2. This means that the door connecting room (x_1, y_1) and room (x_2, y_2) is locked. Note that room (x_2, y_2) should be adjacent either to the right or to the bottom of (x_1, y_1), i.e. x_2 + y_2 should be equal to x_1 + y_1 + 1.

There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n and d (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 10^3 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stations and the constant from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains n - 2 integers: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations.

Every spell is characterized by two values x_{i} and y_{i} \u2014 damage per second and mana cost per second, respectively. Vova doesn't have to use a spell for an integer amount of seconds. More formally, if he uses a spell with damage x and mana cost y for z seconds, then he will deal x\u00b7z damage and spend y\u00b7z mana (no rounding). If there is no mana left (mana amount is set in the start of the game and it remains the same at the beginning of every fight), then character won't be able to use any spells. It is prohibited to use multiple spells simultaneously.\n\nAlso Vova can fight monsters. Every monster is characterized by two values t_{j} and h_{j} \u2014 monster kills Vova's character in t_{j} seconds and has h_{j} health points. Mana refills after every fight (or Vova's character revives with full mana reserve), so previous fights have no influence on further ones.\n\nVova's character kills a monster, if he deals h_{j} damage to it in no more than t_{j} seconds using his spells (it is allowed to use more than one spell in a fight) and spending no more mana than he had at the beginning of the fight. If monster's health becomes zero exactly in t_{j} seconds (it means that the monster and Vova's character kill each other at the same time), then Vova wins the fight.\n\nYou have to write a program which can answer two types of queries:\n\n  1 x y \u2014 Vova's character learns new spell which deals x damage per second and costs y mana per second.  2 t h \u2014 Vova fights the monster which kills his character in t seconds and has h health points. \n\nNote that queries are given in a different form.

If k_{i} = 1, then character learns spell with x = (a_{i} + j) mod 10^6 + 1, y = (b_{i} + j) mod 10^6 + 1.  If k_{i} = 2, then you have to determine if Vova is able to win the fight against monster with t = (a_{i} + j) mod 10^6 + 1, h = (b_{i} + j) mod 10^6 + 1. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor every query of second type print YES if Vova is able to win the fight with corresponding monster and NO otherwise.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3 100\n1 4 9\n2 19 49\n2 19 49\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example Vova's character at first learns the spell with 5 damage and 10 mana cost per second. Next query is a fight with monster which can kill character in 20 seconds and has 50 health points. Vova kills it in 10 seconds (spending 100 mana). Next monster has 52 health, so Vova can't deal that much damage with only 100 mana.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":5}

You may consult the following example coding questions and their answers to provide the code. Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nTheory\n This section does not need to be read and can be skipped, but it does provide some clarity into the inspiration behind the problem.\nIn music theory, a major scale consists of seven notes, or scale degrees, in order (with tonic listed twice for demonstrative purposes):\n\nTonic, the base of the scale and the note the scale is named after (for example, C is the tonic note of the C major scale)\nSupertonic, 2 semitones (or one tone) above the tonic\nMediant, 2 semitones above the supertonic and 4 above the tonic\nSubdominant, 1 semitone above the median and 5 above the tonic\nDominant, 2 semitones above the subdominant and 7 above the tonic\nSubmediant, 2 semitones above the dominant and 9 above the tonic\nLeading tone, 2 semitones above the mediant and 11 above the tonic\nTonic (again!), 1 semitone above the leading tone and 12 semitones (or one octave) above the tonic\n\nAn octave is an interval of 12 semitones, and the pitch class of a note consists of any note that is some integer\nnumber of octaves apart from that note. Notes in the same pitch class sound different but share similar properties. If a note is in a major scale, then any note in that note's pitch class is also in that major scale.\n\n Problem  \nUsing integers to represent notes, the major scale of an integer note will be an array (or list) of integers that follows the major scale pattern note, note + 2, note + 4, note + 5, note + 7, note + 9, note + 11. For example, the array of integers [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12] is the major scale of  1.\nSecondly, the pitch class of a note will be the set of all integers some multiple of 12 above or below the note. For example, 1, 13, and 25 are all in the same pitch class.\nThirdly, an integer note1 is considered to be in the key of an integer note2 if note1, or some integer in note1's pitch class, is in the major scale of note2.  More mathematically, an integer note1 is in the key of an integer note2 if there exists an integer i such that note1 + i \u00d7 12 is in the major scale of note2. For example, 22 is in the key of of 1 because, even though 22 is not in 1's major scale ([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]), 10 is and is also a multiple of 12 away from 22. Likewise, -21 is also in the key of 1 because -21 + (2 \u00d7 12) = 3 and 3 is present in the major scale of 1. An array is in the key of an integer if all its elements are in the key of the integer.\n\nYour job is to create a function is_tune that will return whether or not an array (or list) of integers is a tune. An array will be considered a tune if there exists a single integer note all the integers in the array are in the key of. The function will accept an array of integers as its parameter and return True if the array is a tune or False otherwise. Empty and null arrays are not considered to be tunes. Additionally, the function should not change the input array.\n Examples \n\n```python\nis_tune([1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12]) # Returns True, all the elements are in the major scale  \n    # of 1 ([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]) and so are in the key of 1.\nis_tune([1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]) # Returns True, 14 and 15 are also in the key of 1 as \n    # they are in the major scale of 13 which is in the pitch class of 1 (13 = 1 + 12 * 1).\nis_tune([1, 6, 3]) # Returns True, arrays don't need to be sorted.\nis_tune([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]) # Returns False, this array is not in the \n    # key of any integer.\nis_tune([2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13]) # Returns True, the array is in the key of 2 (the arrays\n    #  don't need to be in the key of 1, just some integer)\n```\n\nAnswer:\ndef is_tune(notes):\n    return bool(notes) and any(\n        all((n + i) % 12 in {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11} for n in notes)\n        for i in range(12)\n    )\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the past century, a new style of music composition has emerged. Unlike more traditional methods based on keys and chords, the technique known as dodecaphony focuses on using all twelve notes equally. As a quick reminder, the twelve notes, in ascending order are,\\[ C, C\\sharp , D, D\\sharp , E, F, F\\sharp , G, G\\sharp , A, A\\sharp , B \\]\n\nThe sequence then wraps around so that the next note after $B$ is $C$ and so on. For this problem, we\u2019ll ignore equivalent notations that use flats, double sharps, or double flats.\n\nEach successive note above is considered one semitone away from the next. Now in our simplified version of dodecaphony, a melody is a permutation of the previous melody by one of three relations.\n\nFirst, we have transposition, where each note has been shifted up by $n$ semitones. A retrograde is when the notes have their order reversed. Finally we have inversion about the first note of the melody. With inversions, the first note doesn\u2019t change, but the rest of the notes are inverted such that the the interval (number of semitones) between that note and the first note is negated.\n\nFor example, if $F$ is our first note, and we want to invert an $A\\sharp $, which is $5$ semitones higher, the inverted note would be a $C$, which is $5$ semitones lower. Note that the first note in an inverted melody is always just the first note of the original melody.\n\nGiven two melodies, can you tell what relation the second has to the first?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $2 \\leq l \\leq 50$, the number of notes in each melody.\n\nThe next two lines each contain $l$ space separated notes.

Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the $a_i$ normal monsters.\n\nIf Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level $i$ $(1 < i < n)$ are levels $i - 1$ and $i + 1$, the only adjacent level of level $1$ is level $2$, the only adjacent level of level $n$ is level $n - 1$). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with $d$ teleportation time.\n\nIn order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. \n\nZiota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns).

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $n$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^{5}$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ ($-10^{9} \\le a_{i} \\le 10^{9}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the rearranged version of array $a$ which satisfies given condition. If there are multiple valid rearrangements, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n6\n5 -2 4 8 6 5\n4\n8 1 4 2\n\nOutput\n5 5 4 6 8 -2\n1 2 4 8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, after given rearrangement, $|a_{1} - a_{2}| = 0 \\le |a_{2} - a_{3}| = 1 \\le |a_{3} - a_{4}| = 2 \\le |a_{4} - a_{5}| = 2 \\le |a_{5} - a_{6}| = 10$. There are other possible answers like \"5 4 5 6 -2 8\".\n\nIn the second test case, after given rearrangement, $|a_{1} - a_{2}| = 1 \\le |a_{2} - a_{3}| = 2 \\le |a_{3} - a_{4}| = 4$. There are other possible answers like \"2 4 8 1\".\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-4}
