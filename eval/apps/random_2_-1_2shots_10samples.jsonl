Last year, his younger brother came to visit him during this time of the year. This year, the Chef is planning to go visit his brother. Chef's brother has planned to throw a \"Welcome Party\" for him. He wants to invite people from his neighbourhood (i.e. from the street where he lives). There are N houses on the street in a single line (not considering the brother's house). He wants the party to be fun and he will not like to invite people who might spoil the mood of the party. If people are invited from three consecutive houses on the street, they might create trouble. As they say, three's a crowd! He doesn't want to ruin the Chef's Welcome Party and so he will not want to send invites to any three consecutive houses. He wants you to tell him how many ways are there for him to go wrong. Note that he can play safe by not inviting anyone to avoid a crowd.\n\n-----Input:-----\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains a line containing a single integer N described above.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case output a single integer denoting the number of ways the brother can go wrong with planning the party.\n\nThe answer can get quite large.

Your task is to implement a Bubble sort (for some help look at https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bubble_sort) and return a list of snapshots after **each change** of the initial list.\n\ne.g. \n\nIf the initial list would be l=[1,2,4,3] my algorithm rotates l[2] and l[3] and after that it adds [1,2,3,4] to the result, which is a list of snapshots.\n```\n[1,2,4,3] should return [ [1,2,3,4] ]\n[2,1,4,3] should return [ [1,2,4,3], [1,2,3,4] ]\n[1,2,3,4] should return []\n```\n\nAnswer:\ndef bubble(l):\n    ret = []\n    for i in range(len(l) - 1, 0, -1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if l[j] > l[j + 1]:\n                l[j], l[j + 1] = l[j + 1], l[j]\n                ret.append(l[:])\n    return ret\nExample 2:\nAs [breadcrumb men\u00f9s](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Breadcrumb_%28navigation%29) are quite popular today, I won't digress much on explaining them, leaving the wiki link to do all the dirty work in my place.\n\nWhat might not be so trivial is instead to get a decent breadcrumb from your current url. For this kata, your purpose is to create a function that takes a url, strips the first part (labelling it always `HOME`) and then builds it making each element but the last a `` element linking to the relevant path; last has to be a `` element getting the `active` `class`.\n\nAll elements need to be turned to uppercase and separated by a separator, given as the second parameter of the function; the last element can terminate in some common extension like `.html`, `.htm`, `.php` or `.asp`; if the name of the last element is `index`.something, you treat it as if it wasn't there, sending users automatically to the upper level folder.\n\nA few examples can be more helpful than thousands of words of explanation, so here you have them:\n```python\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com\/pictures\/holidays.html\", \" : \") == 'HOME : PICTURES : HOLIDAYS'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.codewars.com\/users\/GiacomoSorbi\", \" \/ \") == 'HOME \/ USERS \/ GIACOMOSORBI'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.microsoft.com\/docs\/index.htm\", \" * \") == 'HOME * DOCS'\n```\nSeems easy enough?\n\nWell, probably not so much, but we have one last extra rule: if one element (other than the root\/home) is longer than 30 characters, you have to shorten it, acronymizing it (i.e.: taking just the initials of every word); url will be always given in the format `this-is-an-element-of-the-url` and you should ignore words in this array while acronymizing: `[\"the\",\"of\",\"in\",\"from\",\"by\",\"with\",\"and\", \"or\", \"for\", \"to\", \"at\", \"a\"]`; a url composed of more words separated by `-` and equal or less than 30 characters long needs to be just uppercased with hyphens replaced by spaces.\n\nIgnore anchors (`www.url.com#lameAnchorExample`) and parameters (`www.url.com?codewars=rocks&pippi=rocksToo`) when present.\n\nExamples:\n```python\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com\/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example\/example.htm\", \" > \") == 'HOME > VLUMSYME > EXAMPLE'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com\/users\/giacomo-sorbi\", \" + \") == 'HOME + USERS + GIACOMO SORBI'\n```\n\nYou will always be provided **valid url** to webpages **in common formats**, so you probably shouldn't bother validating them.\n\nIf you like to test yourself with actual work\/interview related kata, please also consider this one about building [a string filter for Angular.js](http:\/\/www.codewars.com\/kata\/number-shortening-filter).\n\n_Special thanks to [the colleague](http:\/\/www.codewars.com\/users\/jury89) that, seeing my code and commenting that I worked on that as if it was I was on CodeWars, made me realize that it could be indeed a good idea for a kata_ :)\n\nAnswer:\nfrom re import sub\n\nignoreList = [\"THE\", \"OF\", \"IN\", \"FROM\", \"BY\", \"WITH\", \"AND\",  \"OR\",  \"FOR\",  \"TO\",  \"AT\",  \"A\"]\n\ndef generate_bc(url, separator):\n    # remove leading http(s):\/\/ and trailing \/\n    url = sub(\"https?:\/\/\", \"\", url.strip(\"\/\"))\n    \n    # skip index files\n    url = sub(\"\/index\\..+$\", \"\", url)\n    \n    # split url for processing\n    url = url.split(\"\/\")\n    \n    # remove file extensions, anchors and parameters\n    url[-1] = sub(\"[\\.#\\?].*\", \"\", url[-1])\n    \n    # first element is always \"home\"\n    menu = [\"HOME\"]\n    # generate breadcrumb items\n    for item in url[1:]:\n        # replace dashes and set to uppercase\n        item = sub(\"-\", \" \", item.upper())\n        # create acronym if too long\n        if len(item) > 30:\n            item = \"\".join([w[0] for w in item.split() if w not in ignoreList])\n        menu.append(item)\n    \n    # generate paths\n    path = [\"\/\"]\n    for i in range(len(url) - 1):\n        path.append(path[i] + url[i+1] + \"\/\")\n    \n    # generate html code\n    html = []\n    for i in range(len(url) - 1):\n        html.append(\"<a href=\\\"\" + path[i] + \"\\\">\" + menu[i] +\"<\/a>\")\n    html.append(\"<span class=\\\"active\\\">\" + menu[-1] +\"<\/span>\")\n    \n    return separator.join(html)\n\nQUESTION:\nYou have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections.

Hero's method can be obtained from Newton's method which came 16 centuries after. \n\nWe approximate the square root of a number `n` by taking an initial guess `x`, an error `e` and repeatedly calculating a new approximate *integer* value `x` using: `(x + n \/ x) \/ 2`; we are finished when the previous `x` and the `new x` have an absolute difference less than `e`.\n\nWe supply to a function (int_rac) a number `n` (positive integer) and a parameter `guess` (positive integer) which will be our initial `x`. For this kata the parameter 'e' is set to `1`.\n\nHero's algorithm is not always going to come to an exactly correct result! For instance: if n = 25 we get 5 but for n = 26 we also get 5. Nevertheless `5` is the *integer* square root of `26`.\n\nThe kata is to return the count of the progression of integer approximations that the algorithm makes.\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n```\nint_rac(25,1): follows a progression of [1,13,7,5] so our function should return 4.\n\nint_rac(125348,300): has a progression of [300,358,354] so our function should return 3.\n\nint_rac(125348981764,356243): has a progression of [356243,354053,354046] so our function should return 3.\n```\n\n#\n\nYou can use Math.floor (or similar) for each integer approximation.\n \n#\n\nNote for JavaScript, Coffescript, Typescript:\n\nDon't use the double bitwise NOT ~~ at each iteration if you want to have the same results as in the tests and the other languages.\n\nAnswer:\ndef int_rac(n, guess):\n    \"\"\"Integer Square Root of an Integer\"\"\"\n    x = guess\n    cnt = 1\n    while True:\n        newx = (x + n \/\/ x) \/\/ 2 \n        if abs(x - newx) < 1:\n            return cnt\n        x = newx\n        cnt += 1\nExample 2:\nVasya's telephone contains n photos.

It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.\n\nFor each photo it is known which orientation is intended for it \u2014 horizontal or vertical. Phone is in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change orientation of the photo.\n\nVasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch as many photos as possible.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":2}

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-1}

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.\n### Instruction:\nYou are an expert code developer with years of experience. You have been provided with a few examples to help you answer the question.\n\nAs an expert code developer with years of experience, please provide the python code based on the question. You may consult the following example coding questions and their answers to provide the code. Ensure the code is enclosed within triple backticks (```) to mark the start and end of the code block.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nExample 1:\nA system is transmitting messages in binary, however it is not a perfect transmission, and sometimes errors will occur which result in a single bit flipping from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0.\n\nTo resolve this, A 2-dimensional Parity Bit Code is used: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Multidimensional_parity-check_code\n\nIn this system, a message is arrayed out on a M x N grid. A 24-bit message could be put on a 4x6 grid like so:\n\n\n>1 0 1 0 0 1\n>1 0 0 1 0 0\n>0 1 1 1 0 1\n>1 0 0 0 0 1\n\nThen, Parity bits are computed for each row and for each column, equal to 1 if there is an odd number of 1s in the row of column, and 0 if it is an even number. The result for the above message looks like:\n\n\n>1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n>1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n>0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n>1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n>1 1 0 0 0 1\n\nSince the 1st row, and 1st, 2nd and 6th column each have an odd number of 1s in them, and the others all do not.\n\nThen the whole message is sent, including the parity bits. This is arranged as:\n\n> message + row_parities + column_parities\n> 101001100100011101100001 + 1000 + 110001\n> 1010011001000111011000011000110001\n\nIf an error occurs in transmission, the parity bit for a column and row will be incorrect, which can be used to identify and correct the error. If a row parity bit is incorrect, but all column bits are correct, then we can assume the row parity bit was the one flipped, and likewise if a column is wrong but all rows are correct.\n\n Your Task: \n\nCreate a function correct, which takes in integers M and N, and a string of bits where the first M\\*N represent the content of the message, the next M represent the parity bits for the rows, and the final N represent the parity bits for the columns. A single-bit error may or may not have appeared in the bit array.\n\nThe function should check to see if there is a single-bit error in the coded message, correct it if it exists, and return the corrected string of bits.\n\nAnswer:\ndef correct(m, n, bits):\n    l = m*n\n    row = next((i for i in range(m) if f\"{bits[i*n:(i+1)*n]}{bits[l+i]}\".count(\"1\") % 2), None)\n    col = next((i for i in range(n) if f\"{bits[i:l:n]}{bits[l+m+i]}\".count(\"1\") % 2), None)\n    if row is col is None:\n        return bits\n    err = (l + row) if col is None else (l + m + col) if row is None else (row * n + col)\n    return f\"{bits[:err]}{int(bits[err])^1}{bits[err+1:]}\"\n\nExample 2:\nFollowing from the previous kata and taking into account how cool psionic powers are compare to the Vance spell system (really, the idea of slots to dumb down the game sucks, not to mention that D&D became a smash hit among geeks, so...), your task in this kata is to create a function that returns how many power points you get as a psion [because psions are the coolest, they allow for a lot of indepth tactic playing and adjusting for psychic warriors or wilders or other non-core classes would be just an obnoxious core].\n\nConsider both [the psion power points\/days table](http:\/\/www.dandwiki.com\/wiki\/SRD:Psion#Making_a_Psion) and [bonus power points](http:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/psionics-unleashed\/classes\/#Table_Ability_Modifiers_and_Bonus_Power_Points) to figure out the correct reply, returned as an integer; the usual interpretation is that bonus power points stop increasing after level 20, but for the scope of this kata, we will pretend they keep increasing as they did before.\n\nTo compute the total, you will be provided, both as non-negative integers:\n\n* class level (assume they are all psion levels and remember the base power points\/day halts after level 20)\n* manifesting attribute score (Intelligence, to be more precise) to determine the total, provided the score is high enough for the character to manifest at least one power.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```python\npsion_power_points(1,0) == 0\npsion_power_points(1,10) == 0\npsion_power_points(1,11) == 2\npsion_power_points(1,20) == 4\npsion_power_points(21,30) == 448\n```\n\n*Note: I didn't explain things in detail and just pointed out to the table on purpose, as my goal is also to train the pattern recognition skills of whoever is going to take this challenges, so do not complain about a summary description.

If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of sofas in the storehouse.\n\nThe second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the storehouse.\n\nNext d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1, x_2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_1, y_2 \u2264 m) \u2014 coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  \u2260  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.\n\nThe last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 \u2264 cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} \u2264 d - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n3 2\n3 1 3 2\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n10 10\n1 2 1 1\n5 5 6 5\n6 4 5 4\n2 1 2 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n2 2\n2 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. \n\nSo the second one corresponds to the given conditions.\n\nIn the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. \n\nAnd there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.\nPlease write your code using Standard Input, i.e. input() and print().\n### Response:\n","assigned_weight":-1}
